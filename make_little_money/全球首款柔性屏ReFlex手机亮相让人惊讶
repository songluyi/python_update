A new flexible smartphone design could change the way users interact with their devices. ReFlex, developed by researchers at Queen's University, uses 'bend sensors' to control app interactions, and simulates physical forces through detailed vibrations.
The design combines multitouch with bend input, allowing a user to control actions on the phone by bending it. This means that a person can flip through pages on a virtual book just by bending the phone, and it will produce feedback that mimics the real sensation.
