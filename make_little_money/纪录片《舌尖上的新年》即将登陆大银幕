It's been a trend recently for Chinese entertainment shows to move from the small screen to the big screen. The latest follower of this trend is hit food documentary A Bite of China, which is scheduled to hit cinemas with film documentary A Bite of New Year on January 7.
Chen Xiaoqing, the artistic director for the film, said that while the Spring Festival is a remnant of the agrarian age, it still has a place in today's modern society.
