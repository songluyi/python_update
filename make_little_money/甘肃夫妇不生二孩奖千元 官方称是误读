A health official in Northwest China's Gansu Province confirmed last Wednesday that the province's controversial draft family planning regulation promises cash rewards to eligible couples who decide not to have a second child.
The official noted that couples who decided not to have a second child after January 1 cannot apply for the cash reward.
