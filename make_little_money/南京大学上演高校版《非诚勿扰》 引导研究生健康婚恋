The show, staged on Saturday in Nanjing University in the format of a popular Chinese TV dating show "If You Are the One," only saw one couple successfully matched each other and received a 1,000-yuan (154 U.S. dollars) "love fund" from the school.
First started in 2014, the lectures on love at Nanjing University became very popular within and outside of the school. Participants of Saturday's dating show also came from various universities in Nanjing.
