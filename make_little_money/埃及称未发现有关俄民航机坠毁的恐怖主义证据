Egypt issued a preliminary report Monday saying its investigators have found no evidence of terrorism in the October 31 crash of a Russian plane in the Sinai Peninsula that killed 224 people.
埃及星期一发布的一份初步报告称，调查人员未发现与10月31日俄罗斯飞机在西奈半岛上空坠毁有关的恐怖主义证据。那次空难造成224人丧生。
A statement from the civil aviation ministry said the probe into what caused the crash is continuing, but that so far there was nothing to indicate terrorism or some other illegal act.
埃及民航部的一份声明说，对导致飞机坠毁原因进行的调查仍在继续。但是到目前为止，没有任何证据显示有恐怖主义或其它非法行为。
Russia and Western nations, including the United States, have said an explosive device placed on board the Airbus plane brought it down. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility and released pictures of what it said was the bomb.
俄罗斯以及美国等西方国家称，有人在飞机上安放的爆炸装置导致了飞机坠毁。伊斯兰国恐怖组织声称对该事件负责，并公布了它所说的炸弹图片。
The flight took off from the popular Sharm al-Sheikh resort area, and the crash has affected tourism with both Russia and Britain responding by suspending flights to Egypt.
这架班机是从沙姆沙伊赫度假胜地起飞的，坠毁事件导致俄罗斯和英国暂停前往埃及的航班，从而使旅游业受到了影响。
Islamic State said it took down the flight in retaliation for Russia's air campaign in Syria, which began in late September. Russia has drawn criticism from Western governments that say it is conducting airstrikes to back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and not to combat the militant group. The Pentagon noted after the crash that Russia's targets appeared to be more focused on Islamic State.
伊斯兰国恐怖组织称，袭击这架飞机是要报复俄罗斯自9月底以来在叙利亚境内的空袭。西方政府批评俄罗斯说，它空袭行动的目的是支持叙利亚总统阿萨德，而不是为了打击伊斯兰国恐怖组织。五角大楼说，飞机坠毁后，俄罗斯似乎增加了对伊斯兰国恐怖组织目标的打击。
