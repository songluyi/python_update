A 36-year-old high school teacher who suddenly died while proctoring an exam last week stirred up discussions on social media, where the students were criticized for being oblivious to the situation at hand.
According to the post, the students kept their eyes on their exams despite hearing Wu groaning in pain. It was only when they finished did students notice the teacher was foaming at the mouth. Though pointing out that some students eventually alerted a teacher in the next classroom, the post accused the students of showing a lack of empathy and hesitating to react.
