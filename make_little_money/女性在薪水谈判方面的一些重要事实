According to what has come to be known as the Bowles study, women and men are treated differently when they attempt to negotiate. In four different experiments, researchers found evidence that when women asked for better compensation, they were significantly more likely than men to be penalized (fewer wanted to work with them or hire them) by male evaluators. This fact helps to explain why women are less likely than men to negotiate in the first place.
