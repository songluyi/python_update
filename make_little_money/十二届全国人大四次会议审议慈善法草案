China's draft charity law, the country's first to regulate charity activities, bans charity groups from engaging in or sponsoring activities undermining "state security and public interests."
The bill clarifies the registration of charity groups. The applicants should apply to the civil affairs department of county governments or higher levels for establishing a charity organization and will get a reply within 30 days. If the organization meets the standards, the government will approve the application.
