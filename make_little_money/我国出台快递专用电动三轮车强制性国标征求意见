National post and delivery authority has recently released a draft of technical requirements for electric tricycles used by delivery companies for public review. It is the first national compulsory standard for delivery vehicles in China.
The draft also suggests the use of a new kind of electric tricycle equipped with a GPS terminal, a driving record and monitoring platforms. Tricycles used for delivery services should be labeled "express" in front.
