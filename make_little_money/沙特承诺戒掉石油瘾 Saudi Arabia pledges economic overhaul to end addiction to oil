 Saudi Arabia has unveiled a long-awaited plan for a radical transformation of its economy, pledging to end its “addiction to oil” and bolster its private sector in a shift that will see the planned $2tn listing of the state-owned Saudi Aramco.
 沙特阿拉伯出台了一项各方等待已久的计划，拟对该国经济推行根本改革，承诺终结其“石油瘾”，并加强其私营部门。这一转型将包括国有的沙特阿拉伯国家石油公司(Saudi Aramco)计划中2万亿美元的上市。
 Spurred by the collapse in oil prices, the kingdom has set out ambitious targets for economic and social reform under a “Vision 2030” plan that is the brainchild of Mohammed bin Salman, the 30-year-old deputy crown prince and the favoured son of King Salman bin Abdulaziz.
 受油价崩盘的刺激，沙特在“愿景2030”(Vision 2030)计划下为经济和社会改革设定了雄心勃勃的目标。该计划出自穆罕默德•本•萨勒曼(Mohammed bin Salman)的创意，这位现年30岁的副王储是沙特国王萨勒曼•本•阿卜杜勒-阿齐兹(Salman bin Abdulaziz)最喜爱的儿子。
 The kingdom could end its reliance on oil within four years, the prince asserted in a television interview after the Saudi cabinet approved the plan yesterday morning. Saudi Arabia currently derives more than 90 per cent of its budget revenues from hydrocarbons.
 在昨天早晨沙特内阁批准这一计划后的电视访谈中，这位副王储断言，沙特可能在四年内终结对石油的依赖。目前，沙特90%的预算收入来自碳氢化合物。
 “We have an addiction to oil . . . this is dangerous,” Prince Mohammed said in the interview on the state-owned al-Arabiya channel. “It has delayed development of other sectors.” 
 在国有的阿拉伯卫星电视台(al-Arabiya)频道的采访中，穆罕默德表示：“我们有石油瘾……这一点十分危险。它拖累了其他产业的发展。”
 The planned flotation of a 5 per cent stake in Aramco would value the oil company at more than $2tn and mark a historic transformation of the kingdom’s primary economic engine, boosting transparency around the state-owned company’s finances, as well as granting Saudi Aramco more independence from government oil policy.
 对沙特阿拉伯国家石油公司5%的股份计划中的上市交易，将使这家石油企业的估值超过2万亿美元。该交易标志着沙特主要的经济发动机发生历史性转型，提高这家国有企业财务的透明度，还会提高该公司对政府石油政策的独立性。
