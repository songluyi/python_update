Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding said on last Wednesday that it has officially become the world's largest retail platform, with its total online trading volume in the fiscal year ending in March surpassing Wal-Mart's annual sales.
Alibaba said in a statement that the record-breaking GMV shows that the world's largest retail marketplace has shifted from offline to online. "We used 13 years to demonstrate the power of a different business model compared with brick-and-mortar retailers," the statement said.
