Brazilian football legend Pele is suing South Korean electronics giant Samsung, after claiming the firm improperly used a lookalike in an advertisement.
He played for Brazil's victorious World Cup winning teams of 1958 and 1970, scoring in both finals, and was in the squad which won in 1962. With club side Santos he twice won the Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup.
