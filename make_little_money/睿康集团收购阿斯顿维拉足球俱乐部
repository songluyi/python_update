A Chinese businessman has agreed to buy Aston Villa, marking the second time in just over six months that Chinese investors have put money into English football.
一名中国商人已同意收购阿斯顿维拉(Aston Villa)足球俱乐部，这是仅仅6个月多一点时间内，中国投资者第二次投资英国足球俱乐部。
The Birmingham-based team, which has just been relegated from the Premier League, said on Wednesday that Recon Group, a privately owned company controlled by Tony Jiantong Xia, had agreed to acquire 100 per cent of the club.
周三，这家位于伯明翰、刚刚从英超(Premier League)降级的足球俱乐部表示，夏建统(Tony Jiantong Xia)所有的中国民营企业联合睿康集团(Recon Group)已同意收购该俱乐部100%的股权。
The deal, for an undisclosed amount, requires the approval of the Premier League and the Football League. It would mark the end of a two-year sale process by Randy Lerner, the US billionaire who also owns the National Football League’s Cleveland Browns.
该交易的金额尚未公布，交易尚需要得到英超和英冠联赛(Football League)的批准。这将标志着美国亿万富翁兰迪•勒纳(Randy Lerner)为期两年的出售过程画上句号。勒纳还是美国国家橄榄球联盟(National Football League)克利夫兰布朗队(Cleveland Browns)的老板。
