The Shandong food and drug watchdog issued a public notice Saturday evening on hundreds of clues and identities linking 300 suspects to illegal deals of vaccine sales in 24 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
Among those arrested are a mother surnamed Pang and her daughter, who were charged for illegal vaccine sales worth more than 570 million yuan ($88 million). Since 2010, the suspects purchased 25 types of vaccines from more than 100 pharmaceutical salesmen, both licensed and unlicensed and were sold to illegal agents or even local disease control and prevention centers at high prices, according to Jinan Public Security Bureau in Shandong province.
