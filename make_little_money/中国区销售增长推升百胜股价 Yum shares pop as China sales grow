 Shares in the company behind KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell rose nearly 4 per cent in extended trading, after the company reported a 6 per cent rise in first quarter same-store sales at its China division, eclipsing estimates for a 2.1 per cent gain. That compared to a 12 per cent drop in the prior year quarter.
 周三，百胜(Yum)公布了一季度财报，中国区同店销售额上升6%，远超此前2.1%的预估增益，去年同期则下跌了12%。财报公布后，百胜股票在盘后交易中上涨近4%，该公司旗下品牌包括肯德基(KFC)、必胜客(Pizza Hut)和塔可钟(Taco Bell)。
 KFC China saw a 12 per cent jump in same-store sales growth, which the company attributed to a Chinese New Year bucket promotion.
 中国肯德基同店销售猛增12%，百胜将此归因于春节全家桶推广活动。

 That helped the Kentucky-based company report profits of $391m or 93 cents a share, up from $362m or 81 cents a share in the year ago quarter*. Sales were largely flat at $2.6bn. Analysts on Wall Street were looking for earnings of 83 cents, on sales of $2.7bn.
 受此带动，百胜第一季度净利报收3.91亿美元，每股收益0.93美元，去年同期利润为3.62亿美元，每股收益0.81美元，销售额基本持平在26亿美元。华尔街分析师此前预计百胜今年首季每股收益为0.83美元，营收预估为27亿美元。
 Adjusting for one-time items earnings of 95 cents a share, topped estimates for 83 cents.

 Greg Creed, chief executive, said: While it’s early in the year and there may be bumps in the road, we’re confident in raising core operating profit growth guidance to 12%, from 10% previously.
 百胜首席执行官格雷格•克里德(Greg Creed)表示：虽然现在还是年初，前路可能还有颠簸，但我们有信心将核心业务营利增长从之前的10%提高到12%。
 Failure to revive sales in Asia’s largest economy following a food safety scare prompted Yum to announce a plan to spin off its China business late last year. Yum has also reportedly been in talks with KKR and other private equity funds to sell a minority stake in the Chinese business — its largest division.
 由于中国区发生的一次食品安全恐慌，百胜没能重振这个亚洲最大经济体的销售，促使该公司在去年年底宣布计划分拆中国业务。据报道百胜还曾与KKR等私人股本集团洽谈出售中国业务的少数股权。中国业务是百胜旗下最大部门。
 The company has previously said the split should allow each company to target a 15 per cent shareholder return per year.
 百胜此前曾表示拆分中国区业务应该可以让每家公司实现每年15%的股东回报率。
 Yum shares have advanced 13 per cent since the start of last year.
