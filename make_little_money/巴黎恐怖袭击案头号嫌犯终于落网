Salah Abdeslam, the prime surviving suspect for the Paris terrorist attacks was shot in the leg and captured during a police raid in Brussels, Belgium, on last Friday, ending an intensive four-month manhunt.
The gun and bomb attacks on the stadium, bars and a concert hall in Paris on Nov 13 last year killed 130 people and marked the deadliest militant assault in Europe since 2004.
