The Chinese movie mogul behind Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has formed a joint venture with a London-based start-up to launch a film streaming service in China.
出品《卧虎藏龙》的中国电影业巨头已和伦敦一家创业企业组建合资公司，将在中国市场推出电影流媒体服务。
Dong Ping, who sold film production company ChinaVision to Alibaba for $800m in 2014, last year took control of Hong Kong-listed company Huanxi Media. Huanxi will announce on Thursday that it has agreed an alliance with Mubi, a streaming service headquartered in the UK.
2014年以8亿美元把电影制作公司文化中国传播集团(ChinaVision)出售给阿里巴巴(Alibaba)的董平，去年控股了香港上市公司欢喜传媒(Huanxi Media)。周四，欢喜传媒将宣布，已和总部设在英国的流媒体服务供应商Mubi达成联盟。
China’s cinema box office revenues surged 40 per cent last year to $6.8bn and the country will overtake the US as the world’s largest movie market by 2018, according to research group IHS. But its market for film subscription services is still relatively small.
调查集团IHS表示，去年，中国电影票房收入大涨40%，增至68亿美元，到2018年中国将超过美国成为全球最大电影市场。但中国的电影订阅服务市场仍然相对较小。
Netflix, the world’s largest film streaming service, which expanded into 130 more countries this month, has yet to enter China — having failed to obtain permission from the government to do so.
到本月，世界最大的电影流媒体服务供应商Netflix已扩展到了130多个国家。但由于未能获得中国政府的许可，Netflix至今未能打入中国市场。
Huanxi and Mubi said they expected to launch their service in China this year, though they declined to detail how they would obtain the necessary licences from Beijing.
欢喜传媒和Mubi表示，他们期望今年在中国推出电影流媒体服务，不过他们拒绝详述将如何向中国政府取得必要牌照。
“We know how to navigate through all the regulations,” said Steven Xiang, chief executive of Huanxi Media.
“我们知道如何绕过所有的监管规定，”欢喜传媒的首席执行官项绍琨(Steven Xiang)表示。
Mubi’s rivals in the Chinese market include Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, whose video offering iQiyi has more than 10m paying subscribers.
Mubi在中国市场的竞争对手包括阿里巴巴、腾讯(Tencent)和百度(Baidu)。百度旗下的视频网站爱奇艺(iQiyi)拥有逾1000万名付费订户。
