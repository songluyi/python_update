Hanergy, the Chinese solar group, has warned against over-interpreting the unexpected resignation of the group’s founder and controlling shareholder, Li Hejun, from its listed unit.
中国太阳能集团汉能(Hanergy Group)警告称，不要过度解读该集团创始人和控股股东李河君从上市子公司意外辞职。
Hong Kong-listed Hanergy Thin Film Power said late on Friday that Mr Li had resigned as chairman of the board and executive director “for the reason of strengthening corporate governance”. His right-hand man, Frank Dai Mingfang, also resigned, “for the reason of focusing on other business development”. The moves came after the annual board meeting.
在香港上市的汉能薄膜发电（Hanergy Thin Film Power，简称HTF）上周五晚间宣布，李河君“基于加强公司治理的原因”，辞任公司执行董事及董事会主席职务。他的得力助手戴明芳(Frank Dai Mingfang)“基于专注其他业务发展的原因”也辞去职务。这些辞职是在年度董事会会议后宣布的。
But over the weekend, Hanergy Group said that Mr Li remained in charge of the parent company. “Media should not over-interpret” his resignation from the listed unit, the group said, though it gave no further explanation.
但汉能集团周末表示，李河君仍掌控着母公司。该集团称，对于他从上市子公司辞职，“希望媒体和公众不要过分解读”，尽管它本身没有作出进一步解释。
Mr Li owns 74.75 per cent of HTF, according to Hong Kong filings, putting him just shy of the city’s 25 per cent free float requirement.
根据香港的监管申报文件，李河君拥有汉能薄膜发电74.75%股份，使其逼近香港对上市公司至少25%股票须自由流通的要求。
A dizzying rise in HTF’s shares in Hong Kong last year briefly made Mr Li China’s richest man. But the stock’s unusual trading patterns and related transactions also attracted the attention of short sellers who bet that it would be unable to sustain its climb.
去年汉能薄膜发电股价曾出现令人目眩的上涨，一度使李河君成为中国首富。但这只股票的不寻常交易规律和关联交易也吸引了卖空者的关注，他们押注其无法维持升势。
On May 20 last year, the stock plunged 47 per cent in half an hour, wiping out $19bn in value. The company then halted trading. The suspension was enforced in July by Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, which had begun an investigation into the company.
去年5月20日，该股在半小时内暴跌47%，190亿美元的市值就此蒸发。随后该公司停牌。香港证券及期货事务监察委员会(SFC)去年7月更是下令对其强制停牌，当时该监管机构已对汉能薄膜发电启动调查。
