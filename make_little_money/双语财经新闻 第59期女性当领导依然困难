Women saw little advancement in corporate boardrooms and compensation in 2010, extending a 5-year trend in which companies have lagged in promoting and mentoring of women to their own detriment, according to a new study released on Monday.周一发布的一项新调查显示，2010年公司董事会中女性所占比例和女性劳动 报酬几乎没有任何增长。这显示了公司在提拔和指导女性方面做得不足,这种不利 于公司自身发展的趋势在过去五年都没有改变。“Corporate America needs to get ’unstuck‘ when it comes to advancing women to leadership,M said llene Lang, president and chief executive of Catalyst, a non-profit organization that advocates greater opportunities for women.Catalyst公司总裁兼执行总监艾琳?朗说:“美国企业在提拔女性当领导这方面 应该更加开明。”Catalyst是一家非盈利组织，致力于为女性争取更多的机会。The study was based on annual filings made by Fortune 500 companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission or, in the case of insurance companies, to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.这项调查的数据来源于财富500强企业向美国证券交易委员会上交的年度报 表,其中保险公司的数据来自它们向美国保险监督官协会上交的年度报表。The study found that 136 of the Fortune 500 companies had no women executives. Among those with no women were Exxon Mobil, Berkshire Hathaway, Citigroup, Costco Wholesale and Sears, the study said.调査发现,财富500强企业中有136家没有女性高管。这些公司包括埃克森美孚 石油公司、伯克希尔?哈撒韦公司、花旗集团、好市多公司以及西尔斯公司。“This is our fifth report where the annual change in female leadership remained flat. If this trend line represented a patient’s pulse, she’d be dead,” Lang said.朗说:“本年度女性领导的人数变化曲线呈直线型，这已经是我们第五年发布 有类似结果的调査报告。如果用这条直线来体现病人的心跳变化，那表示这个病人 已经死了。”Women held 14.4 percent of executive officer positions in 2010，up from 13.5 percent in 2009, and female executive officers held 7,6 percent of the top earning positions, up from 6.3 percent in 2009, the 2010 Catalyst Census said.Catalyst公司的调查显示2010年女性高管的比例为14.4%,髙于09年的13.5%。 2010女性高管占据“最赚钱职位”的7.6%,2009年这一数据为6.3%。The best five companies in terms of women in the executive suit were: Gap 50 percent, HR Block 50 percent, Limited Brands 50 percent, TIAAg-CREF 50 percent and Western Union 45 5 percent.如果以女性高管所占的比例来衡量，表现最好的五家公司是:盖普公司(50%)、 HR布洛克报税代理公司(50%)、有限品牌公司(50%)、美国教师退休基金会(50%)和 西联国际汇款公司(45.5%)。Women held 15.7 percent of board seats in 2010, a 0.5 percentage point gain over 2009, and more than 10 percent of companies lacked any women on their boards in 2009 and 2010.2010年500强企业的董事会中有15.7%是女性成员，比2009年上升0.5个百分 点。2009年和201阵均有超过10%的公司董事会中没有女性成员。Catalyst research showed men with mentors were promoted more and compensated at a higher rate than women, while women with mentors were far less likely to be promoted or paid more as a result of being mentored.Catalyst公司研究发现，有职业导师的男性比女性更易得到提拔，也更容易拿到 高工资。而女性即使有导师的指导，她们得到晋升或者拿到高薪的可能性也远低于 男性。Companies need to be convinced that diversity in leadership was important, Lang said. “To be successful they have to have more points of view — people from all kinds of background and have diversity in the senior leadership,” she said. “It’s core to the strategy.”朗说:“公司要相信领导层的多样性很重要。一个公司要想成功，就应该听取更 多来自背景各异的人们的不同观点。公司高管层应实现多样化,这是公司战略的关 键。”
