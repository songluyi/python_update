Late last year, the Environmental Investigation Agency, in Washington DC, said Yahoo Japan had auctioned more than 12 tonnes of ivory products, including whole elephant tusks, in 2012-14.
The international environmental campaign group Avaaz addressed its petition to Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer, Manabu Miyasaka, chief executive of Yahoo Japan, part-owned by Yahoo Inc. and Softbank Corp, and "all other companies allowing ivory sales online".
