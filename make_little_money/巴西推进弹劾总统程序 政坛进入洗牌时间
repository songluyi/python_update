A Brazilian congressional committee on Monday voted in favor of moving forward with the impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff.
Before the results were announced, Vice-President Michel Temer was caught in a leaked audio talking as if President Dilma Rousseff had already been impeached. Local media reported that the government was already prepared for such an outcome.
