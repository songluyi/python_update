Apple and China UnionPay announced a partnership on Friday to bring Apple Pay, a mobile payment solution provided by the US tech giant, to its Chinese customers next year.
According to the company, Apple Pay will roll out to China UnionPay cardholders as soon as early 2016 after relevant tests and certification required by Chinese regulators, with the service itself in compliance with the applicable national mobile payment and financial industry standards in China.
