When the British public votes on staying within or leaving the EU in a referendum on June 23, they will decide on the destiny of Britain for decades, perhaps a lifetime, said Cameron, adding: "This is a decision that is bigger than any individual politician or government."
Former London Mayor and leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson said later: "The principle guarantor of peace and stability on our continent has been NATO, and what worries me now is that it is the European Union's pretensions to run a foreign policy and a defense policy that risk undermining NATO."
