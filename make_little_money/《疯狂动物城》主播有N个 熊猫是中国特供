Box-office monster "Zootopia" has been called the "most Easter egg-packed movie ever made by Disney". One of its Easter eggs has a distinctly international flavor when it comes to the species of the news anchor seen on the film's ZNN channel.
In the standard release, seen in locations such as the US, Canada, France, Mexico and Russia; the news anchor is a moose. That moose turns into a tanuki if you live in Japan; Australia and New Zealand get a koala; in Brazil, it's a jaguar; while Chinese audiences see a giant panda.
