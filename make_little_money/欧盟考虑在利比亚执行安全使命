European Union foreign and defense ministers will meet late Monday in Luxembourg to discuss a plan to send security personnel to Tripoli to help train police and border guards for Libya’s new unity government.
欧盟成员国外长和国防部长星期一晚间将在卢森堡举行会谈，讨论向的黎波里派遣安全人员的计划，帮助利比亚新组建的团结政府训练警察和边防人员。
The security mission will only go ahead if requested by the Libyan Government of National Accord. Its first phase is to be restricted just to the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
只有得到利比亚全国团结政府的邀请，欧盟才能执行这项安全使命。计划第一阶段的实施将只限于首都的黎波里。
There is a growing urgency for Libya to be stabilized, with anxiety mounting that people-smugglers will exploit the chaos in the country and as many as 270,000 migrants may seek to travel across the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy this year. That would prompt a new phase in a migration crisis roiling Europe.
利比亚的稳定日益迫切。外界担心人口偷运者会利用利比亚的混乱局面，今年将会有多达27万移民从利比亚经由地中海前往意大利，让欧洲移民危机雪上加霜。
Western fears are rising also about the expansion of an affiliate of the Islamic State terror group in Libya. U.S. officials told VOA they estimate the affiliate now has 6,000 fighters, mainly Tunisians and sub-Saharan Africans.
此外，西方国家越来越担心伊斯兰国一个分支组织在利比亚的壮大。美国官员对美国之音说，估计该分支目前已拥有6000名战斗人员，大多是突尼斯人和撒哈拉以南的非洲人。
The Libyan government has not given the green-light for the security mission.
利比亚政府还没有对欧盟的这项安全使命表示认可。
