 Shopping sprees can be fun. But as the acquisitive Chinese conglomerate Anbang has found, deciding what to do with the purchases afterwards can be more difficult.
 疯狂购物可以让人快乐。但贪婪并购的中国企业集团安邦(Anbang)已经发现，在收购之后，对所购企业做决策可能是件更难的事。
 Anbang has been an enthusiastic buyer of companies over the past 18 months. Its deals, including the art deco Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York, a Korean insurer and a Belgian bank, have taken it a long way from its roots in Chinese car insurance.
 过去18个月，安邦一直在大力地进行企业并购。安邦达成的多笔收购——包括具有艺术风格的纽约华尔道夫酒店(Waldorf Astoria Hotel)、一家韩国保险公司及一家比利时银行——已经让该公司远离了其根源所在的中国汽车保险业务。

 “他们会磨得你筋疲力尽。他们会在每个点上一步步逼你。如果遇到他们不喜欢的，他们就开始说中文。如果你不同意他们说的，他们就称这是中国人的方式。他们每一个点上都要硬磨。”
 Others who have dealt with Anbang say it is fast and decisive, and tends to hire the best advisers. They note that Wu Xiaohui , its low-profile chairman, makes all the big decisions.
 还有一些与安邦打过交道的人表示，安邦行动迅速而果断，往往聘请最好的顾问。他们指出，所有重大决策都由安邦低调的董事长吴小晖做出。
