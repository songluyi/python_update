Apple has trimmed the prices of its newest iPhones in a country where their cost is beyond the reach of most consumers, according to a news report.
Apple apparently needs to be more price competitive in India, the world's third largest smartphone market behind China and the US. Indian consumers typically gravitate toward phones priced under $300, such as those made by Chinese vendor Xiaomi and local brand Micromax. Apple has been grappling with weaker demand for its iPhone 6S lineup in India and just a 2 percent market share as chief rival Samsung leads the field with lower-cost phones manufactured in the country.
