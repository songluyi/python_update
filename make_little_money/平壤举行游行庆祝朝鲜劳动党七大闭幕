North Korea wrapped up a rare Party Congress with an enormous tightly choreographed parade through the centre of Pyongyang on Tuesday, complete with goose-stepping students, models of nuclear missiles and wailing women in traditional Korean dress. 
周二, 朝鲜劳动党的一次全国代表大会闭幕。平壤市中心举行了声势浩大、精心安排的游行活动, 游行队伍中有踢着正步的学生、核导弹模型以及身着朝鲜传统服饰、激动得痛哭流涕的妇女。
As the first such event in the country in 36 years, the Congress appears to have solidified supreme leader Kim Jong Un’s grip on the isolated, nuclear-armed state. 
在36年来首次举行的劳动党全国代表大会上, 朝鲜最高领导人金正恩(Kim Jong Un)似乎巩固了对这个受到孤立的核武国家的控制。
Although very little detail has emerged on any policies or reforms decided at the Congress, the totalitarian state celebrated the “election”of the 33-year-old Mr Kim as chairman of the ruling Worker’s Party of Korea. He had previously held the position of first secretary of the Party. 
至于此次会议决定了哪些政策或改革措施, 目前对外披露的细节甚少。不过, 这个极权国家对33岁的金正恩“当选为”执政党劳动党的委员长表示了庆祝。他之前担任劳动党第一书记。
Every single one of the nearly 3, 500 delegates to the Congress voted in favour of the decision, according to government officials and state media. 
朝鲜政府官员和官方媒体称, 近3500名代表全部对该决定投了赞成票。
“Never tolerate but mercilessly squash any element contrary to the idea and intention of the respected Comrade Kim Jong Un and any slightest act of breaking our single-minded unity, ”read a statement from the Congress. 
“决不容忍并要无情粉碎一切反对尊敬的金正恩同志思想和意愿的势力, 以及一丝一毫破坏我们坚定团结的举动, ”大会发布声明称。
One top general who South Korean intelligence officials had said had been executed earlier this year was named as an alternate member of the Worker’s Party politburo while another general, who many believed had been purged was named to the standing committee of the politburo. 
韩国情报官员口中今年早些时候已遭处决的朝鲜高级将领李永吉, 当选为劳动党政治局候补委员；而许多人认为已遭清洗的另一名将领崔龙海, 当选为劳动党政治局常委。
