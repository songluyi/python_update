As Beijing intensified its blockbuster anticorruption campaign last year, Chinese authorities unveiled Sky Net. Interpol was given the list of 100 names, and foreign governments were exhorted to help out. On Jan. 6, China's top graft-fighting body publicized Sky Net's success so far, since the program was launched last April: 19 individuals had been caught. Only 81 more to go.
In November, China chartered four planes to Cambodia and Indonesia to pick up 254 Chinese who were suspected of participating in a phone and Internet fraud ring.
