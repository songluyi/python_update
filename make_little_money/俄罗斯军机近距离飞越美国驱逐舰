The U.S. expressed concern over Russian military aircraft flying apparent simulated attack passes near a U.S. destroyer in the Baltic Sea over the course of two days this week.
俄罗斯军机本周两天近距离飞越波罗的海的一艘美国驱逐舰并进行模拟攻击飞行，美国对此表示关注。
The U.S. says two Russian attack aircraft flew around 20 passes near the USS Donald Cook while the ship was in international waters.
美国说，两架俄罗斯攻击机在位于国际水域的美国驱逐舰唐纳德·库克号附近进行了约20次飞越。
"There have been repeated incidents over the last year where the Russian military, including Russian military aircraft, have come close enough to each other - or have come close enough to other air and sea traffic - to raise serious safety concerns. And we continue to be concerned about this behavior," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.
The Donald Cook had just come from a port visit in Gdynia, Poland, when the flyovers occurred. It was headed out to sea with a Polish helicopter on board.
飞越事件发生时，唐纳德·库克号刚刚结束对波兰港口格丁尼亚的访问后驶离，当时船上停有一架波兰直升机。
NATO has been asked to provide a permanent presence of battalion-sized deployments of allied troops in the Baltic States. Moscow denies any intention to attack the Baltic states.
