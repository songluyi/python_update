Students in Nanjing University will no longer have to worry about their seats in the library being taken up by someone else when they temporarily leave their seats.
According to the rules, those who book the seat have the priority to use the seat, but they also have to observe a time limit. They must take the seat and scan the QR code on the seat within 20 minutes of the library opening. If not, they will get a violation record.
