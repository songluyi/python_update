Officials who commit severe corruption crimes, such as taking a huge amount of bribes, may face a new sentence now - life imprisonment without parole, according to an interpretation issued on Monday by the top judiciary authorities.
But under the new interpretation, convicts found guilty of embezzling or accepting bribes will not have a chance to leave prison if they are given the sentence, Pei said.
