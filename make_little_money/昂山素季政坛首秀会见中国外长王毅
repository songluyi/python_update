The foreign ministers of China and Myanmar met on last Tuesday in Nay Pyi Daw, Aung San Suu Kyi's first official act in international diplomacy since being appointed Myanmar's foreign minister.
Zhang said that both countries are keen to improve bilateral ties following Myanmar's political transition, and the new administration's campaign to improve people's livelihood and end ethnic conflicts requires China's support.
