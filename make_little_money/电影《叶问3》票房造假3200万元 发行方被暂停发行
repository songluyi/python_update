China's film market watchdog has ordered Beijing Max Screen to suspend distribution for a month after it committed fraud to jack up the box office figures for martial arts film "Ip Man 3."
"These kinds of issues could be considered inevitable in a young industry, but box office fraud has become so serious that it is already harming Chinese cinema," said Zhang Hongsen, head of the film bureau.
