Chinese students who aim to further their higher education in the European Union (EU) will benefit from an extension of at least nine months of stay after their studies end, according to new rules agreed on by the European Parliament on last Wednesday.
"I am very happy to hear about this as now I am seeking to apply for my second masters degree in London and this will allow me more chances to stay longer in UK after my graduation," said Li Siyu, finance major in Leicester University who would graduate in September.
