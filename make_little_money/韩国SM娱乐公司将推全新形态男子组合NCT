The company that pioneered South Korea's all-conquering K-pop industry unveiled its new boy-band concept on Wednesday -- a group with limitless members, singing in multiple languages and based in cities from Asia to Latin America.
The group, or rather collection of sub-groups, will go under the umbrella title of NCT, which stands for Neo Culture Technology -- a name that some fans quickly took to ridiculing on social networks.
