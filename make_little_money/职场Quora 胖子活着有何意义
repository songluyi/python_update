What is the point of living if you're very fat?
如果你很胖的话，你活着的意义是啥？
1. Why wouldn't the usual reasons for living apply?
为什么就不能因为很平常的原因活着呢？
Goals and dreams.Loved ones.Pleasure and happiness.Curiosity.Religion and spirituality.
目标跟梦想。你所爱的人。快乐跟幸福。好奇心。信仰跟精神。
2. Being alive is pretty great. Sometimes, people decide it's not great, and in fact it's so terrible that they don't want to be alive anymore. But most of us try to keep living. Fat has nothing to do with that. Why would it? Maybe you think fat people are worthless. That says more about you than it does about fat people.
活着本身就已经很了不起了。有时候，人们觉得活着也不见得有多伟大，事实上一个人如果不想活了的话，那就太可怕了。但是我们当中的大多数人都想要活着。肥胖跟那个完全没有关系。为什么呢？可能你会觉得胖的人是没有什么价值的。但是胖的人在这方面比你更有话语权。
3. I imagine that what motivates them to keep living is their thoughts, ideas, feelings, passions, projects, goals, dreams. They live because they love, hate, cherish, yearn, despise and embrace.What motivates them to keep living is who they are, not how they look.
我想像他们活下去的动力是他们的思想、观点、感受、感情、计划、目标跟梦想。它们活着是因为他们会爱、会恨、会珍惜、会向往，会鄙视以及会拥抱。支撑着他们继续活下去的动力是他们本身而不是他们的样子。
4. That's a pretty narcissistic view of life. No one exists just for your benefit. How about you focus on what you are doing to improve the world instead of why other people exist?
那是一种很自恋的生活观点。没有人是为了你的利益的存在的。如果仅仅只关注你对这个世界所做的贡献而在乎为什么其他人会存在的话，你会怎么样？
5. Ah, this sounds like troll bait. I'm very slender but I don't look at people who weigh more than me and feel better about myself. Honestly, I've known plenty of people who are overweight according to society's standards, and I still find some of them attractive.
啊，这听上去挺有趣。我很苗条，但我从不盯着那些比我重的人看，或是自我感觉很良好。说实话，我认识很多体重超重于社会标准的人，但是我仍然觉得他们中的一些人很有吸引力。
