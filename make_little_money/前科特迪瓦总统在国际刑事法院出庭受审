The war crimes trial of former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo began Thursday at the International Criminal Court.
前科特迪瓦总统巴博星期四在国际刑事法院出庭受审，他被控犯有战争罪。
Gbagbo, the first former head of state to be tried at The Hague, is facing charges of crimes against humanity, including rape and murder, for the four month-long conflict in 2010 that left 3,000 people dead. Prosecutors say the 70-year-old Gbagbo launched the war to cling to power, despite losing the presidential election to his rival, Alassane Ouattara.
巴博是在海牙受审的第一个前国家元首，他被控在2010年持续4个月的武装冲突中犯有强奸和谋杀等反人类罪。2010年的冲突导致3000人死亡。检察官说，现年70岁的巴博在总统选举中败给对手瓦塔拉后，为了继续掌权而发动战争。
The conflict finally ended after France, Ivory Coast's former colonial ruler, sent in troops to restore order and arrest Gbagbo.
科特迪瓦前宗主国法国派军队恢复科特迪瓦的秩序，并逮捕了巴博，武装冲突终告结束。
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the ICC headquarters before the start of the trial to show their support for Gbagbo.
审判开始前，数以百计的示威者聚集在国际刑事法院外面，以示对巴博的支持。
The ICC also has a warrant for the former president's wife, Simone, on charges of crimes against humanity. She was sentenced last year to a 20-year prison sentence by an Ivorian court.
国际刑事法院也向被控犯有反人类罪的巴博的妻子席蒙发出逮捕令，但她已于去年被一个科特迪瓦法庭判处20年监禁。
