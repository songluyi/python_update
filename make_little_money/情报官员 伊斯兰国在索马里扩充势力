索马里一名高层情报官员告诉美国之音索马里语言组说，亲伊斯兰国的索马里激进分子人数增多，而且得到来自也门的资金和军事支持。
Abdi Hassan Hussein, the former Director of the Puntland Intelligence Agency (PIA) said when the pro-IS Somali faction was founded in October last year it had about 20-30 men, but has since set up training camps and recruited more fighters. He said the group’s fighters now number between 100-150 fighters.

He said Islamic State has welcomed its Somalia branch and has started delivering supplies through their affiliate faction in Yemen.
侯赛因表示，伊斯兰国对索马里分支表示欢迎，并开始通过在也门的关系为其提供物资。
