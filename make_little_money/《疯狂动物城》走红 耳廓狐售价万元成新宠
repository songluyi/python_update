The release of the computer-animated film "Zootopia" has given rise to illegal online sales of fennec foxes as the character of a con artist fox in the movie has attracted many fans.
'After seeing the movie Zootopia, my daughter became crazy about fennec foxes and demanded one for a pet,' the parent said. 'However, I found that they can only be traded privately because they are a protected species.'
