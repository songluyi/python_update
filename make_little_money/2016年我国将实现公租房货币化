China's housing minister said on Monday that governments will stop building rental housing units to accommodate migrant workers and people displaced by demolitions or renovations of urban residences or shantytowns.
That agenda dovetails with a broader plan to assimilate 274 million migrant workers as urban residents, providing a new source of demand for housing, education and other consumption tied to the economy.
