Myanmar’s parliament has voted to elect Htin Kyaw as the country’s next president.
缅甸议会通过表决，推选吴廷觉为下届总统。
The retired bureaucrat from the National League for Democracy (NLD) won 360 out of the 652 votes cast in a joint meeting of the legislature.
退休官员吴廷觉是缅甸全国民主联盟成员。他在议会联席会议表决中，赢得了652票中的360票。
Htin Kyaw is not a member of parliament, but he is a close confidant of NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
吴廷觉不是议员，但他是全民联领袖昂山素季的密友。
The Nobel Laureate is the obvious favorite of most Myanmar citizens, but she is barred from becoming president because both of her sons have foreign citizenship.
昂山素季在缅甸深孚众望，但因为她的两个儿子都是外国公民，所以不能担任总统。
However, Aung San Suu Kyi has declared she will retain ultimate power over her handpicked president. The military will remain powerful in the new government because it automatically holds one-quarter of the parliamentary seats and will control several key ministries.
然而，昂山素季曾宣称将凌驾于自己挑选的总统之上，掌握绝对权力。缅甸军方自动拥有四分之一议席，并控制着几个关键的部，因此仍具有强大的势力。
The army’s candidate for president, General Myint Swe, placed second in the three man race and will become the first vice president.
在3位总统候选人当中，军方候选人敏瑞将军得票居第2位，将出任第1副总统。
