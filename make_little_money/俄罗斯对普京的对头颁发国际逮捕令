A Russian court has issued an international arrest warrant for Mikhail Khodorkovsky, former Yukos Oil chief and critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
俄罗斯一家法庭对前尤科斯石油公司总裁、俄罗斯总统普京的批评人士米哈伊尔·霍多尔科夫斯基发出国际逮捕令。
Russian police accuse Khodorkovsky, who is now based in London, of ordering the killing of the mayor of a Siberian oil town.
霍多尔科夫斯基现居伦敦，俄罗斯警方指控他下令杀害了一个西伯利亚石油城的市长。
Khodorkovsky denies the charges. On Wednesday he said via social media that the charges are a response to his pro-democracy work.
霍多尔科夫斯基否认有关指控。他星期三透过社交媒体说，这些指控是对他从事民主运动的报复。
The businessman was arrested in 2003 and convicted of tax evasion and fraud. Khodorkovsky says those charges -- which resulted in a decade in prison -- were motivated by his financial support of the political opposition.
霍多尔科夫斯基2003年被捕，被判犯有逃税和欺诈罪，为此坐牢10年。霍多尔科夫斯基表示，他受到这些指控是因为他向政治反对派提供财政支持。
Since his release in 2013, Khodorkovsky has lived in exile and founded a pro-democracy movement called Open Russia, aimed at Russian political reform.
霍多尔科夫斯2013年获释后一直流亡海外。他开创了一个名为“开放俄罗斯”的民主运动，目的是推动俄罗斯政治改革。
Khodorkovsky was accused Wednesday of ordering the murder of Vladimir Petukhov, mayor of the town of Nefteyugansk, for financial gain. On Tuesday, Russian police raided some Moscow locations linked to Open Russia.
他星期三被控出于经济利益谋杀了涅夫捷尤甘斯克市市长拉基米尔·别图霍夫。俄罗斯警方星期二突袭了莫斯科几处与“开放俄罗斯”有关联的地点。
