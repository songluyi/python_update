Syria said Tuesday it accepts a cease-fire plan proposed by the United States and Russia that would begin Saturday.
叙利亚星期二表示，同意接受美俄提出的停火协议，协议星期六开始生效。
A government statement said the military will continue its operations against Islamic State and al-Qaida-linked groups.
叙利亚政府发表声明称，政府军将继续打击伊斯兰国组织和与基地组织有关联的团体。
The U.S.-Russia plan does not apply to those militants, and any other groups have until Friday to confirm their participation. The main Syrian opposition High Negotiations Committee said late Monday it agrees to the cease-fire as long as its demands for the lifting of sieges, delivery of humanitarian aid and an end of bombings of civilians are met.
美俄停火协议不适用于这些激进分子，其他组织可在周五前确定是否参加停火。叙利亚主要反对派--高级谈判委员会周一晚间表示，只要它提出的解除封锁、保证人道救援物资运输以及停止对平民轰炸等条件得到满足，就同意停火。
In a joint statement Monday, the U.S. and Russia said that under the plan parties involved in the conflict would limit any use of force to situations such as responding in self-defense. The parties would also agree to provide unhindered access to humanitarian groups delivering aid to besieged areas.
美俄两国周一发表联合声明说，按照停火协议的规定，冲突各方只能在自卫时使用武力。参与停火的各方还同意让人道组织不受阻碍地为被围困地区运送救援物资。
