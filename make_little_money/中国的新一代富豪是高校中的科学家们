Chinese President Xi Jinping has called upon the country's best and brightest to make more breakthroughs in science and technology, with billions of yuan being pumped into higher education.
A survey published in the scientific journal Nature concluded that university scientists in China made on average $40,000 a year in 2010, while their counterparts in the U.S. made double that amount. Now, the gap is vanishing.
