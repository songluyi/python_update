China has no intention to stimulate exports through competitive currency devaluation, and there is no basis for the renminbi to continue exchange rate depreciation, Premier Li Keqiang said while meeting with Suma Chakrabarti, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development on Friday in Beijing.
Meanwhile, the premier briefed Chakrabarti on China's recent financial reform, saying it is aiming to establish a regulatory framework to prevent systemic risks, which at the same time suits the development of modern financial markets.
