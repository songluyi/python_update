Japan and South Korea have agreed to settle the issue of wartime “comfort women” in a landmark deal that could transform ties between the neighbours and reshape the diplomatic map of East Asia.
日本和韩国已就解决战时“慰安妇”问题达成协议，这一里程碑式的协议可能会彻底改变这两个邻国之间的关系、重塑东亚外交版图。
Under the accord, Japan will pay $8.3m into a fund for surviving victims, based on “painful awareness” of its responsibilities for the system of forced prostitution during the second world war.
根据协议，日本将向一支为依然健在的受害者设立的基金出资830万美元，理由是日方“痛苦地意识到”要为二战期间的强制卖淫制度负责。
If the deal sticks, it promises the “final and irrevocable” settlement of an issue that has scarred relations between the two main US allies in East Asia and has provided an effective diplomatic tool to China.
如果这一协议得到确立，有可能会“最终且不可逆转地”解决慰安妇问题。该问题为美国在东亚的两个主要盟友之间的关系留下了伤痕，并为中国提供了一个有效的外交工具。
Fumio Kishida, Japanese foreign minister, hailed the deal as “historic and epoch-making” — but some former comfort women in South Korea rejected it because Japan acknowledged no legal liability.
日本外相岸田文雄Fumio Kishida)称赞该协议具有“历史性的和划时代的”意义，但部分前韩国慰安妇拒绝接受该协议，因为日本不承认负有法律责任。
