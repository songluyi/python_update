The battle between the U.S. Justice Department and Apple returns to a federal courtroom Monday as the government tries to get the iPhone maker to comply with an order to help it access the phone of a mass shooter.
美国司法部与苹果公司星期一将在一家联邦法院展开交锋。美国政府试图迫使苹果公司遵从一项法官的命令，协助当局获取大规模枪击案凶手法鲁克的手机所存信息。
A magistrate judge said last week Apple must provide software to allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to guess the password on an iPhone given to Syed Rizwan Farook by his employer before he and his wife Tafsheen Malik killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California last year.
一名法官上星期说，苹果公司必须提供一种软件，使联邦调查局得以破解法鲁克的iPhone密码。去年，法鲁克和他的妻子马利克在加利福尼亚州的圣巴尔纳迪奥杀害了14人。
But Apple rejected what it called the "unprecedented" order to create a backdoor that could allow someone with the software to access any iPhone and put its customers at risk of hacking.
但苹果公司拒绝服从这项它所称的“没有先例”的命令，不同意提供帮助获取iPhone所存信息的软件，使其客户面临遭黑客入侵的危险。
The government fired back with a motion to make Apple comply, and ahead of Monday's hearing FBI Director James Comey insisted the government is not trying to set any precedent for future cases or "set a master key loose on the land."
美国政府进行反击，向法院提出申诉，以迫使苹果公司就范。联邦调查局局长科米在星期一举行法院听证之前强调说，美国政府并不试图为今后设立一个先例，也不会“丢下一把任人使用的万能钥匙”。
