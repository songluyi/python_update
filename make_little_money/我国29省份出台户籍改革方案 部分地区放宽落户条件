The reform of the housing registration, or hukou system, has been under way in most regions in China following the State Council's call to establish a unified household registration system for urban and rural residents in a document issued in 2014.
In mega cities such as Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan and Xi'an, point-based hukou policies are prevalent. The policies, despite their variance in different places, generally take into account the factors of the legitimacy of a person's job and residence, insurance and a fixed number of years he or she has lived in the city.
