More than 1m refugees and migrants have arrived by land and sea in the European Union this year, the UN refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration said Tuesday.
Up to 7,000 migrants are currently holed up in the shanty town outside Calais which is called 'The Jungle'. Again the figures do not cover those who entered undetected.
