The US government has announced that it is launching a cyber warfare campaign against the Islamic State (IS). This is the first instance of the US publicly using cyber attacks as a tool in warfare.
Isil's cyber capabilities have been well documented. It released a security manual that revealed part of its cyber strategy in the week after the Paris attacks.
