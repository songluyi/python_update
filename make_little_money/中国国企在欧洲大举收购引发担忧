 China’s richest man says his country’s state-owned enterprises are short-termist and lack international management standards. Nevertheless, SoEs dominated a surge of Chinese investment into Europe last year, raising a series of questions over the suitability of China Inc as an owner of European corporate assets.
 中国首富王健林表示，中国国有企业是短期主义者，并且缺乏国际管理标准。然而，中国国有企业引领了去年中国对欧洲投资的飙升，这引发了一系列关于中国企业是否适合拥有欧洲企业资产的疑问。
 Self-made billionaire Wang Jianlin, chairman of Dalian Wanda Group and one of China’s biggest outward investors, criticised SoEs for being slow and lacking long-term overseas expansion strategies.
 白手起家的亿万富翁王健林是大连万达集团(Dalian Wanda Group)的董事长，也是中国最大的对外投资者之一。王健林批评中国国有企业行动迟缓，缺乏长远的海外扩张战略。
 “The bosses of state-owned enterprises are unable to set long-term goals because their position will be replaced in two or three years,” Mr Wang told an audience at Oxford university last week. “Moreover, state-owned enterprises do not have international standards for their management systems, and have long cycles for their approval process,” he added.
 王健林上周在牛津大学(Oxford)发表演讲时表示：“国企老总无法制定长期目标，因为他们在两三年后就会被换掉。此外，国企管理体系缺乏国际标准，而且审批程序冗长。”
 He cited an example. When bidding for a real estate project in London, Mr Wang said, he was given one week to complete or the asset would go up for auction, resulting in a higher price.
 他举了一个例子。王健林表示，在试图拿到伦敦的一个房地产项目时，他只有一周时间来完成交易，否则资产将会挂牌拍卖，价格就会上升。
 “I made the quick decision to go for it, signed the agreement and paid the cash in three days,” he said. “In a similar situation, it would have been very difficult for a state-owned enterprise to make that swift decision.”
 他说：“我迅速决定拿下它，签署协议并在3天内付了款。在类似的情况下，国有企业很难这么快做出决定。”
 His warning comes as new data show SoEs accounted for 70 per cent of a record
