China's media watchdog said it has ordered Internet celebrity "Papi Jiang" to take her videos offline on last Sunday due to her use of "swear words and insulting language" in the show.
The blogger has responded on Weibo that she accepts the criticism and will revise the videos. Yang Ming, the CEO of Papi Jiang's team behind the viral videos, also said that they have been made aware of their shortcomings and will heed the authorities' call for revision.
