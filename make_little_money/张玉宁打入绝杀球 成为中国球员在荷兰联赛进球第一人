Chinese forward Zhang Yuning scored his first goal, also the maiden goal for a Chinese footballer, in Dutch top flight league on Sunday, propolling Vitesse Arnhem to a 2-1 victory over Roda JC.
The Chinese striker, who joined the Dutch club last July, becomes the first ever Chinese to find the net in the Dutch league. Zhang, considered as a future soccer star by Chinese national team interim coach Gao Hongbo, was called up to national team the first time in February for China's remaining two World Cup qualifiers against Maldives and Qatar.
