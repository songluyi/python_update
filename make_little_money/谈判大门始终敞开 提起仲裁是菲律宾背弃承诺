China said on last Thursday the door for dialogue with the Philippines on the South China Sea is always open, refuting the country's argument that bilateral dialogue has come to an end.
He said the two countries have had close contact and several rounds of consultation on trust, managing disputes and maritime cooperation yet the Philippines have never had any conversation with China on any of its appeals of the arbitration case. "The argument that 'bilateral dialogue has come to an end' is indeed another lie made up by the Philippines," said Hong.
