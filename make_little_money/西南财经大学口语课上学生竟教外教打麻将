An oral English class at a university in Sichuan province recently stumbled upon a way to improve communication skills: the students, from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE) taught their foreign teacher how to play mahjong.
In the picture he uploaded, a foreign lady is looking at the mahjong tile in her hand beside a makeshift table of three desks. Next to her is a Chinese girl, advising the woman on her next move.
