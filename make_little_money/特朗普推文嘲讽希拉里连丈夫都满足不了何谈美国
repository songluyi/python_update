In a Thursday night tweet sent from Trump's Twitter account to his nearly 3 million followers, Trump quoted a Twitter user questioning how a Hillary Clinton presidency could "satisfy America" if she is unable to "satisfy her husband."
The original tweet Trump quoted, which was flagged by TPM, came from Sawyer Burmeister, an equestrian champion. Burmeister made it known in subsequent apology tweets that it was a "political joke," while telling those she offended to "get some rest."
