German police lifted a terrorism alert in the Bavarian city of Munich, hours after evacuating two train stations in the face of a New Year's Eve suicide bomb threat.
德国警方解除了巴伐利亚州慕尼黑市的恐怖主义威胁警告。几个小时之前，有人威胁要在新年除夕进行自杀炸弹袭击，当局为此疏散了两个火车站。
Munich police chief Hubertus Andrae told reporters Friday that officials had taken precautions because of a "very concrete" tip that suicide attacks were planned for the city's train stations at midnight, at the height of Munich's New Year's celebrations.
慕尼黑警察局局长安德雷星期五对记者表示，有关官员先前发出警告，因为根据“非常具体的”线索，有人计划在午夜时分，也就是在慕尼黑迎新年活动的高潮，对火车站进行自杀炸弹袭击。
Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said a friendly foreign intelligence service had given them word that between five and seven Islamic State militants were planning the attacks.
巴伐利亚州内政部长赫尔曼表示，一个友邦的情报部门提供情报说，有5到7个伊斯兰恐怖分子在策划袭击。
Munich's main train station and a suburban station in the western borough of Pasing were closed for about four hours, from shortly before midnight until about 3:30 a.m. New Year's Day. The re-opening allowed morning trains to depart on schedule Friday.
慕尼黑的主要火车站和一个郊区火车站为此关闭了四个小时，从午夜之前不久关闭到元旦凌晨三点半。火车站重新开放之后，火车按星期五的时刻表准时发车。
Despite the precautions, thousands of people celebrated the evening in the streets of Munich without incident.
虽然有恐怖主义威胁警告，但除夕夜依然有成千上万的人在慕尼黑街道上举行了迎新年的庆祝活动，也没有发生任何状况。
