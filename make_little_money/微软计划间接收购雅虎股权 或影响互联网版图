Microsoft Corp executives are in talks with private equity firms considering bids for Yahoo Inc saying the company might be willing to lend "significant financing" to their efforts, reported technews site Recode.
Microsoft's move is an attempt to ensure a good partnership with Yahoo's buyer, said the website citing unnamed sources, as the company maintains close search and advertising ties with Yahoo.
