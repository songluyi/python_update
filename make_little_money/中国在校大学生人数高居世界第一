In 1949 when the People's Republic of China was founded, only 117,000 students were attending colleges or universities. But the number soared to 37 million in 2015 - the world's largest student population.
"The fast development of higher education in China has offered more ordinary Chinese people the opportunity to attend college. It has also provided intelligent support for the dramatic transformation of Chinese society," said Wu Yan, director of the Higher Education Evaluation Center. "Colleges and universities are playing increasingly important roles in the country's efforts to innovate."
