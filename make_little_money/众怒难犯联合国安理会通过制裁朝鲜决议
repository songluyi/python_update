The UN Security Council adopted a resolution on last Wednesday that imposes new sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in order to curb the country's nuclear and missile programs.
The resolution includes a ban on all exports of strategic materials from the DPRK. It also puts out a ban on supplying aviation fuel to the DPRK. Moreover, it requires member states to inspect all cargo going to and from the DPRK.
