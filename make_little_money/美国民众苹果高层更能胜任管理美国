Apple (33 percent) would do a better job than politicians taking over U.S. government operations, says a new Breakout BrandsTM survey by rbb Communications. The national survey tapped opinions on a variety of brand preferences.
"Building a relationship with today's consumer is a lot like dating," says Christine Barney, managing partner and CEO of rbb Communications. "Brands like Apple do well at the dating game because they get into the consumers' heads to achieve the kind of meaningful emotional connections that lead to loyalty."
