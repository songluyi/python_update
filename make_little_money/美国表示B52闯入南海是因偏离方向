U.S. officials said Saturday its two B-52 bombers didn't intend to fly over China's artificial island in the South China Sea, after Beijing scolded Washington and accused them of a "serious military provocation" in the disputed waters.
Mark Wright, a Pentagon spokesman, said that there was "no intention of flying within 12 nautical miles of any feature." A senior U.S. defense official told The Wall Street Journal that bad weather may have contributed to the pilot flying off course and into the area where China claims.
