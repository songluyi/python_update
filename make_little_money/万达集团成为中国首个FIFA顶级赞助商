Conglomerate Wanda Group has become the first Chinese top-tier partner of world football governing body Fifa. It is the first big deal of new Fifa President Gianni Infantino's reign, and the first since the scandals that engulfed the organisation.
Although Wanda is the first Chinese firm to enter at this top level, another Chinese firm, Yingli Solar - a solar panel provider - was a second-tier Fifa sponsor of the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.
