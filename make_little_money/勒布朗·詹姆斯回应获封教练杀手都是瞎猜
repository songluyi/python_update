Speaking to the media after Wednesday morning's shootaround, Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James made a point of responding to recent criticism stemming from the organization's decision to fire coach David Blatt.
"It sucks," James said. "But what can I do about it? I've never, in my time since I picked up a basketball, ever undermined a coach, ever disrespected a coach. You ask any of my little league coaches, my high school coaches, coaches I've played for in tournaments, camps, my NBA coaches. I've always respected what they wanted to do. And I'm not the owner of a team, I'm not the GM of a team. I'm the player of a team.
