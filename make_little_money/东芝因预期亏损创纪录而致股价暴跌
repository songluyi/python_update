Shares in Toshiba fell 12 per cent to six-year lows on Tuesday, a day after the Japanese company warned of a record annual loss of Y550bn ($4.5bn) as a result of massive costs involved in slashing 10,600 jobs and streamlining its units.
周二，东芝(Toshiba)股价暴跌12%，至6年低点。一天前，这家日本企业警告称，由于裁减1.06万个工作岗位及精简部门所导致的巨额成本，公司将遭遇创纪录的5500亿日元（合45亿美元）年度亏损。
Within hours of announcing its restructuring measures on Monday, analysts grilled Toshiba’s management on whether the actions — which did not promise a complete withdrawal from its television and laptop businesses — went far enough to restore investor confidence after the company’s $1.3bn accounting scandal.
周一东芝宣布其重组措施的数小时里，分析师们纷纷盘问东芝管理层，在该公司发生涉及13亿美元的会计丑闻后，上述行动是否足以重振投资者的信心。东芝的这些行动并不涉及承诺完全撤出电视机和笔记本电脑业务。
The bigger question for the 140-year-old Japanese group is whether it can draw a blueprint for growth following the restructuring, after the affair exposed most of its businesses as struggling.
对这家有140年历史的日本企业来说，更大的问题是，在会计丑闻暴露出该公司的多数业务正在苦苦挣扎后，经过重组的东芝能否描绘出一幅增长蓝图。
Toshiba shares sank 12 per cent on Tuesday to Y223.5, their lowest since March 2009, after shedding 9.8 per cent on Monday ahead of the announcement. The two-day declined wiped $2bn off the company’s market capitalisation, according to Bloomberg calculations.
周二，东芝股价暴跌12%，至每股223.5日元，为2009年3月以来的低点。而在周一重组措施宣布前，该公司股价已然下跌了9.8%。根据彭博(Bloomberg)的计算，连续两天的暴跌令该公司市值蒸发了20亿美元。
The semiconductor-to-nuclear conglomerate said it expected its net loss to expand to Y550bn for the fiscal year through March 2016, from Y37.83bn the previous year. It attributed the forecast loss to Y260bn in restructuring costs, saying it would also forgo dividend payment. Sales are projected to decline 6.8 per cent to Y6.2tn.
这家涉足从半导体到核能等多种业务的综合性企业表示，预计在截至2016年3月的这个财年里，净亏损将从上一年的378.3亿日元扩大至5500亿日元。东芝将这一预期中的亏损归因于2600亿日元的重组成本，表示公司还将放弃派息。该公司的销售额预计会下滑6.8%，至6.2万亿日元。
Toshiba is expected to shed or relocate about 5 per cent of its global workforce by the end of the financial year. The cuts include about 6,800 jobs in the lossmaking personal computer and TV consumer electronics businesses.
截至本财年结束，东芝预计会把其全球工作岗位的约5%裁撤或迁至他处。遭裁撤的岗位包括处于亏损中的个人电脑和电视机等消费类电子业务的岗位，这部分岗位大约有6800个。
The group also agreed to sell its TV plant in Indonesia to Chinese electronics maker Skyworth and terminate sales of TVs in overseas markets. It is also in talks with Fujitsu to merge their laptop businesses, which could eventually be integrated with Sony’s spun-off PC division.
该集团还同意把其位于印尼的电视机厂卖给中国电子产品制造商创维(Skyworth)，并停止在海外市场上销售电视机。此外，该集团还在与富士通(Fujitsu)展开磋商，准备合并双方的笔记本电脑业务——最终或将与索尼(Sony)剥离出来的个人电脑部门整合。
The company will shrink annual sales volumes of TVs and PCs to 600,000 units and 3m units respectively. Some analysts said that such targets would be difficult to achieve and asked why the company did not simply shutter the businesses.
东芝将把电视机和个人电脑的年销售量分别压缩至60万台和300万台。一些分析师表示这样的目标将很难实现，并质疑该公司为何不干脆关闭这些业务。
