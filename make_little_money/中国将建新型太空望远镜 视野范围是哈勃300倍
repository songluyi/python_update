China has announced an ambitious space telescope program that would give the nation astronomy research capabilities to rival those of U.S. programs like the Hubble Space Telescope, according to Popular Science. The space telescope would have a lens 2 meters in diameter, giving it a field of view 300 times larger than that of the Hubble.
The ambition of China's program, announced in a parliamentary meeting earlier this year, doesn't end there. The new telescope would be put into orbit next to the Tiangong 3 space station, planned for launch in 2022, and would be capable of docking with it. Keeping the space telescope close to the Tiangong 3 would allow Chinese astronauts, or taikonauts, to service it much more readily. (It took NASA three-and-a-half years and four servicing missions to fix a problem with the Hubble's mirror after it launched.) China's space telescope program could pave the way for assembling spacecraft in orbit, too.
