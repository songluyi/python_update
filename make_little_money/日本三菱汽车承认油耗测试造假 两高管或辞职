Mitsubishi Motors Corp's top two executives are likely to resign over the Japanese automaker's manipulation of fuel economy data, Japanese media reported on last Wednesday, in a scandal that has halved the company's market value in a week.
Japan's sixth-biggest automaker said on last Tuesday it used fuel economy testing methods that did not comply with Japanese regulations for 25 years. It said it would set up an external committee to investigate the matter and report the results in three months.
