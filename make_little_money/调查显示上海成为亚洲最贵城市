Shanghai is Asia's most expensive city for expatriates and the world's seventh-most expensive for them, according to a recent cost-of-living survey that also cited China's strengthening currency, the renminbi, as the main cause.
"In spite of the minor depreciation in the renminbi against the dollar over the summer, it has strengthened against most other currencies, leading to Shanghai becoming the most expensive Asian city for international assignees," said ECA's Asia regional director, Lee Quane, in a news release.
