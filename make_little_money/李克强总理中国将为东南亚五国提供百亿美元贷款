China will offer 11.5 billion dollars in loans and credit lines to five Southeast Asian countries for infrastructure and other projects, Premier Li Keqiang said on last Wednesday.
Li added that he would push China's new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and its Silk Road fund to also fund projects in the region, and ensure a greater use for China's yuan currency in dealings with the five countries.
