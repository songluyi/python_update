A scheme to steal 1 million yuan ($153,000) and give to needy children did not go as planned for one man in the city of Chongqing.
Surveillance video from the community placed Luo and his accomplice at the scene, while more footage aided police in tracking Luo to his home. Both men claimed innocence until police showed them the recording.
