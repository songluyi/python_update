Spokesman Lu Kang made the remarks at a daily press briefing in response to claims that the Philippines initiated arbitration due to the two countries' very unequal strengths which makes it unable to solve maritime delimitation disputes with China through dialogue.
China adheres to the path of peaceful development and follows a national defense policy that is defensive in nature. China persists in building good-neighborly relationships and partnerships with its neighbors and in solving disputes through dialogue and negotiation, said Lu.
