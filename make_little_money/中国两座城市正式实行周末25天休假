Government employees in two Chinese cities can now enjoy 2.5 days' weekly leave, twice a month, starting from April 1.
Giving further details, the National Tourism Administration said the 2.5 days weekly leave policy would not involve a cut in working hours, as time could be made up on other days, guaranteeing a 40-hour working week.
