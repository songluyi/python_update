A two-and-a-half minute video of a young woman cursing and screaming at a gang of scammers in a hospital wait room went viral in China on Jan. 25, receiving almost 40,000 comments and being shared over 100,000 times on China's Sina Weibo.
According to reports that later appeared in state media, the woman lives in Beijing on a shoestring budget with her ailing mother. She speaks with a distinct northeastern Mandarin accent.
