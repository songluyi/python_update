 Two brothers with suspected links to the November terrorist plotters in Paris were named by Belgian state media on Wednesday as the suicide bombers in Tuesday’s double bombing at Brussels airport.
 周三，比利时官方媒体公布了周二布鲁塞尔机场两起爆炸中两名自杀式炸弹袭击者的名字。这两人为兄弟，人们怀疑他俩与去年11月巴黎恐怖袭击案的策划者有关联。
 Citing police intelligence, Belgian broadcaster RTBF identified the two men as Khalid and Brahim El Bakraoui. Khalid was reported to have rented a safe house in the Brussels district of Forest, which became the scene of a gun battle with police last week.
 比利时法语区电视台及电台(RTBF)援引警方的情报称，这两人是哈立德•巴克拉维(Khalid El Bakraoui)和卜拉欣•巴克拉维(Brahim El Bakraoui)。据报道，哈立德在布鲁塞尔福雷区(Forest)租了一间藏身的房子，上周恐袭嫌犯曾在该区与警方发生枪战。
 Khalid is also believed to be the man who rented a flat in the southern Belgian city of Charleroi used by the Paris conspirators in the weeks leading up to the November attacks, Belgian media reported.
 比利时媒体报道称，哈立德据信还曾在比利时南部城市沙勒罗瓦(Charleroi)租下一套公寓。在去年11月巴黎恐怖袭击案之前几周，袭击策划者曾使用过这一公寓。
 A third man caught on CCTV at Zaventem airport alongside the brothers, dressed in a white jacket and a hat, is the subject of an active manhunt.
 扎芬特姆机场(Zaventem airport)闭路电视的摄像头还拍到与兄弟俩在一起的另一名男子。这名男子身着白色夹克，头戴一顶帽子，警方正在积极搜捕这名男子。
 The revelations, if confirmed, will raise new questions about how much Belgian authorities knew about the Islamic State cell that is suspected of carrying out the co-ordinated attacks in the Belgian capital, which left at least 30 dead and wounded hundreds.
 这些爆料如果得到证实，将提出一个新的问题：对于这个涉嫌在比利时首都展开协调袭击、导致至少30人死亡和数百人受伤的伊斯兰国(Islamic State)活动小组，比利时当局到底了解多少？
 Local press reported that Belgian prime minister Charles Michel would meet his French counterpart Manuel Valls on Wednesday afternoon.
 当地媒体报道称，周三下午，比利时首相夏尔•米歇尔(Charles Michel)将会晤法国总理曼努埃尔•瓦尔斯(Manuel Valls)。
 Mr Valls told French radio that it was now imperative to tighten controls on the European Union’s borders after the bombings in Brussels.
 瓦尔斯曾向法国的电台表示，在布鲁塞尔发生爆炸案后，现在迫在眉睫的是要收紧对欧盟(EU)边境的管控。
