Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has said strains between Russia and the West have pushed the world "into a new cold war".
The Cold War was a period of ideological confrontation between the former Soviet Union and Western countries. It began after World War Two and ended with the collapse of the Soviet-led communist camp in the 1989. The 45 years of tension were marked by espionage and proxy wars involving client states. The Nato alliance was established in 1949 to protect Western countries.
