An informal "street count" by staff of City of Sydney council and volunteers has identified 486 homeless people sleeping rough in the inner city, the highest figure since the initiative was launched in 2010.
Declining housing affordability was contributing to the high numbers of homeless people identified by the count, which was almost 25 per cent higher than last year.
