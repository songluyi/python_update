Royal Dutch Shell moved to bolster shareholder support for its proposed takeover of BG Group after Chinese regulators on Monday gave the deal their approval.
荷兰皇家壳牌(Royal Dutch Shell)正着手争取股东支持拟议中的收购英国天然气集团(BG Group)的交易。此前，中国监管机构在周一批准了这一交易。
Shell announced that the combined group would cut up to 2,800 staff upon completion, or 3 per cent of the enlarged workforce, as it looks to secure one of the largest energy deals of recent years amid the oil price crash. Brent crude was trading at $37 on Monday.
壳牌宣布，合并后的集团在交易完成后会裁撤总计2800名员工，占合并后员工总数的3%，该集团将寻求在油价暴跌之际，敲定这项近年最大规模的能源协议之一。周一，布伦特(Brent)基准原油的价格为每桶37美元。
Shares in BG fell 0.7 per cent on Monday to close at 9.20, and are about 10 per cent lower than the price outlined by Shell in its cash-and-stock bid, partly reflecting some concern that shareholders might not approve the deal.
周一，英国天然气集团的股价下跌0.7%，收于每股9.2英镑，比壳牌以现金和换股方式开出的价码中给出的大致价格低了大约10%，这在一定程度上反映出某些人对股东可能不会批准这一交易的担忧。
The takeover requires the support of a majority of Shell shareholders and 75 per cent of those at BG.
这次收购需要得到壳牌多数股东和英国天然气集团75%的股东的支持。
