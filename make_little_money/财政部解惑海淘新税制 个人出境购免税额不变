The new tax on imported goods purchased from e-commerce sites will not affect Chinese travelers who buy abroad, the Ministry of Finance said on last Saturday.
According to the authority, the rules for tourists returning from abroad remain unchanged, with purchases up to the value of RMB5,000 exempt from duties. The new tax relates only to e-commerce platforms that allow consumers to order imported goods online to be delivered through postal services.
