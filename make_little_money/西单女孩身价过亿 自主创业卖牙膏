Ren Yueli was once a street singer in an underground passage in Xidan, in downtown Beijing. Her interpretation of the song "Angel's Wings" went viral online in 2009. Netizens named her the "Xidan girl."
However, Ren said in an interview with Chengdu Commercial Daily: "It is an exaggerationto say that I'm a multimillionaire. That's just the valuation of our products. Business is sort of a secondary profession for me; I am still a singer, and that's my main career."
