Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has arrived in Pakistan to meet with his counterpart on a previously unannounced visit to India's rival neighbor; the first such visit in 12 years.
印度总理莫迪抵达巴基斯坦，在事先没有宣布的情况下，访问印度的劲敌邻国巴基斯坦，并会晤巴基斯坦总理。这是12年来印度总理首次访问巴基斯坦。
Modi announced the visit earlier Friday during a stop in Afghanistan, saying he was "looking forward to meeting" with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
莫迪星期五早些时候在阿富汗停留期间做出上述宣布。他说，他“期待会晤”巴基斯坦总理谢里夫。
Modi was received by Sharif at the airport in the eastern city of Lahore. The two leaders immediately boarded a helicopter to be flown to the venue where they are expected to hold formal talks.
莫迪在东部城市拉合尔的机场受到谢里夫的欢迎。两位领导人立即登上直升飞机，前往他们预计举行正式会谈的地点。
The two leaders first resumed high-level contact between the two nations with a brief conversation two weeks ago in Paris at an international climate conference.
两个星期前，这两位领导人在巴黎一个国际气候会议上进行了短暂交谈，首次恢复两国间高层接触。
Relations between the nuclear neighbors have been strained for the entirety of Pakistan's existence, after it split off from India in 1947, both gaining independence from Britain.
巴基斯坦1947年与印度分离以来，这两个拥有核武器的邻国关系一直紧张。两国都是脱离英国殖民统治独立建国的。
