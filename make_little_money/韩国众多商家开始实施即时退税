South Korean department stores will start offering instant tax refund services to foreign customers starting in February as part of an effort to boost sales, market watchers said Sunday.
Seoul announced last year that it would implement changes to the way all local tax-free shops operate in 2016 by making it easier for tourists to spend in the country without the need to hold onto purchase receipts that must be shown at departure to get tax refunds.
