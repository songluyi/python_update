A father and son suffered internal organ injuries and were hospitalized last Monday after drinking hot chocolate at a McDonald's restaurant in Southwest China's Chongqing, where an employee mistakenly added disinfectant instead of hot water to the drink.
The son took a sip first and refused to drink it anymore. Feng thought maybe the drink was too hot and asked the son to wait until it cooled down. After the son finished the meal, Feng found the drink almost untouched and decided to drink it himself, according to Chongqing Evening News.
