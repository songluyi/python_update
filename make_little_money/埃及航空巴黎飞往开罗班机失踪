希腊和埃及的搜救人员正在寻找埃及航空公司一架失踪客机，这架班机星期四从巴黎飞往开罗途中失踪，机上有66名乘客和机组人员。
The carrier said that it lost contact with Flight MS804 at 2:30am Cairo time, when the Airbus A320 was at an altitude of about 11,278 meters and approximately 16 kilometers inside Egyptian airspace. The cause of the plane's disappearance was not immediately clear, but airline officials said the aircraft may have crashed.
埃及航空公司说，在开罗时间凌晨2时30分与这架空客A320客机失去联络，当时该班机的飞行高度约为1万1278米，刚刚进入埃及领空16公里左右。目前还不清楚班机失踪的原因，但民航官员说，这架客机可能已经坠毁。
The airline stated that Egyptian armed forces received a distress message before communication with the plane was lost; however, a military spokesman posted on his Facebook page a statement denying a distress call had been received.
埃及航空证实，在与这架班机失联之前，埃及军方曾收到求救信号。但埃及军方发言人在脸书上发表声明，对此予以否认。
Fifty-six passengers were on board, including one child and two infants. Saudi officials say the flight included passengers from France, Britain, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Chad, Portugal, Algeria and Canada. No U.S. citizens were reported among the missing.

Aviation experts are reiterating that at this point too little is known to draw any conclusions.
航空专家再三重申，目前了解的情况太少，还不能下任何结论。
