March 21 is the next Apple event. Things kick off at 10am local time at Apple headquarters in Cupertino. The Town Hall auditorium at Infinite Loop is a tiny venue compared to the last event in September 2015, which was at the giant Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.
The invitation says, "Let us loop you in." Just a play on Infinite Loop? Probably. We'll tell you on the 21st.
