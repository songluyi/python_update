Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has replaced Apple as the world's most valuable listed company after the company's first set of results under its new structure beat expectations.
Alphabet reported a 5.3pc increase in fourth-quarter profits to $4.9bn on Monday night and an 18pc increase in revenue to $21.3bn, as Google's web advertising business continued to go from strength to strength.
