China will end subsidies for new-energy vehicles (NEVs) after 2020, but analysts said on Sunday that government support for the sector is still needed.
The MOF plans to cut the subsidies progressively, by 20 percent from 2016 levels during the 2017-18 period, and by 40 percent between 2019 and 2020. The subsidies will be eliminated altogether after 2020.
