FIFA acknowledged last Wednesday that bribes were paid for votes in bids for the 1998 and 2010 World Cups, and the organization is trying to recoup tens of millions of dollars in damages.
FIFA claims it is the victim of corrupt individuals, despite widespread criticism that bribe-taking was embedded in its culture in the presidencies of Joao Havelange and Sepp Blatter. FIFA wants compensation from those accused for the damage illegal actions caused to FIFA's brand, reputation and business relationships.
