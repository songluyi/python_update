The Canadian military plane carrying 163 Syrians arrived late Thursday in Toronto.
星期四晚间，加拿大军用飞机运载163名叙利亚人抵达多伦多。
The refugees were greeted upon their arrival by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the ministers of immigration, health and defense, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and Toronto Mayor John Tory.
这些难民抵达加拿大时，加拿大总理特鲁多、移民部长、卫生部长、国防部长、安大略省省长韦恩以及多伦多市长托利都到机场迎接。
Trudeau said "This is a wonderful night . . . we get to show the world how to open our hearts and welcome in people who are fleeing extraordinarily difficult situations."
特鲁多说，“今天晚上太好了，加拿大向世界展示了怎样诚心接纳那些逃离极端艰难处境的人们。”
Canada is set to welcome 25,000 refugees by the end of February.
加拿大计划在明年2月底之前接纳2万5千名难民。
Canada's embrace of the refugees is in contrast to the United States where a presidential candidate, several governors and ordinary citizens have been very vocal in their stance that the refugees should not be allowed into the country.
加拿大接纳叙利亚难民的态度与美国形成对照，在美国，一名总统参选人、几名州长以及很多普通民众都直言不讳地表明立场，认为不应该允许难民进入美国。
