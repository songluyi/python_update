Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has urged efforts to deepen human-centered urbanization as it can improve people's livelihoods and boost economy.
A regulation that upgrades "residence permit" management, announced by the State Council in December last year and effective from this month, will ensure city dwellers that have not yet acquired Hukou have access to basic public services including education, employment, medical care and legal assistance, according to the statement.
