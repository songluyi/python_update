Freight train 79213 loaded with nearly 200 motorcycles set off from Guangdong's Foshan railway freight station at 11 a.m. on Jan. 26. This is the first freight train carrying motorcycles in the history of China for Spring Festival.
In recent years, some migrant workers in Guangdong from Guangxi, Hunan and Guizhou provinces braved the cold to ride a thousand miles back home, due to not being able to buy train tickets or needing to use motorcycles after returning home. The Guangzhou Railway Group specifically organized a freight train this year so that the motorcycles could also be taken home.
