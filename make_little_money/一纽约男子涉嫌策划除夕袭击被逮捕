The U.S. Justice Department says authorities have arrested a New York state resident accused of planning to kill civilians on New Year's Eve in the name of the Islamic State group.
美国司法部说，有关当局逮捕了纽约州一位居民，此人被指控策划在新年除夕以伊斯兰国组织的名义杀害平民。
A statement during an initial court appearance Thursday morning says Emanuel Lutchman, 25, was charged with attempting to provide material support to IS. He was described in court records as a "self-professed Muslim convert with a criminal history dating back to approximately 2006 . . . as well as previous state mental hygiene arrests."
根据星期四早上首次出庭时宣读的一份声明，25岁的卢奇曼被控试图向伊斯兰国组织提供物质支持。根据法庭记录，卢奇曼称自己已经皈依伊斯兰教。记录还说，他有刑事犯罪前科，可以追溯到大约2006年，而且曾因精神健康问题被州政府逮捕。
The statement said, "the defendant, claiming to receive direction from an overseas [Islamic State] member, planned to commit an armed attack against civilians at a restaurant/bar located in the Rochester, New York, area." Court records said Lutchman had armed himself with knives, a machete, duct tape, zip ties and ski masks.
