Hong Kong is to limit the number of non-resident children getting vaccinations at government clinics, after an illegal vaccine scandal in mainland China raised fears some families would come to the city for inoculations and put pressure on supplies.
Mainland Chinese authorities said this month a mother and daughter had illegally traded nearly $90 million worth of vaccines and sold them on to hundreds of re-sellers around the country, prompting an outcry from parents and political leaders.
