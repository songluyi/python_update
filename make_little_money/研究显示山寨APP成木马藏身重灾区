Fake apps are posing a growing threat to unsuspecting mobile phone users, the Beijing Times reported Tuesday. The fake apps come installed with malicious software that can track private data.
Fake apps also hurt the interests of a mobile game developer surnamed Liu. He said he invested nearly one million yuan ($153,000) in designing a game and received 1,000 downloads per day. However, at least seven fake apps quickly appeared, eating away at his market share. "I was almost bankrupt because of pirated software," Liu said.
