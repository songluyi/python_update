A fake university established as part of a sting operation to expose student visa scams has netted 21 suspects in mass arrests carried out by American immigration authorities.
Those arrested acted as brokers who allegedly conspired with more than 1,000 foreign nationals, mainly from India and China, to falsely maintain student visas and foreign worker visas through a "pay to stay" scheme. Some of those arrested are naturalised US citizens, while others are legal permanent residents.
