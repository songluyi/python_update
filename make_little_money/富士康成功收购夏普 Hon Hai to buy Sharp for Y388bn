 Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry has agreed to buy Sharp for Y388bn ($3.46bn), putting an end to the takeover saga.
 台湾富士康（Foxconn，又名鸿海精密(Hon Hai Precision Industry)）已同意以3880亿日元（合34.6亿美元）收购夏普(Sharp)，为这场漫长而一波三折的收购画上了句号。
 The struggling Japanese electronics maker agreed to a bailout by Hon Hai, better known as Foxconn, back in February, in a deal involving Y489bn of new stock to the Taiwanese group which would give it a 66 per cent controlling stake in Sharp.
 今年2月，夏普这家深陷困境的日本电子设备制造商同意接受富士康的纾困。在这一交易中，夏普将向富士康发行4890亿日元新股，富士康在夏普的持股比例将因此达到66%，从而掌握控股权。
 However, the deal abruptly stalled after Sharp provided its rescuer with what Hon Hai called “new material information”, which people familiar with the matter said were Y300bn in potential liabilities.
 然而，在夏普向富士康提供了后者所称的“新的关键文件”后，这一交易突然陷入停滞。知情人士表示，这一新信息指的是3000亿日元的潜在债务。
 After further evaluation, Hon Hai lowered its takeover price by Y100bn to Y388bn, which Sharp has now agreed.
 经过进一步的估值后，富士康将其报价下调了1000亿日元，至3880亿日元。夏普现已接受这一报价。
 Terry Gou, founder of Hon Hai, said:“I am thrilled by the prospects for this strategic alliance and I look forward to working with everyone at Sharp. We have much that we want to achieve and I am confident that we will unlock Sharp’s true potential and together reach great heights.”
 富士康创始人郭台铭(Terry Gou)表示：“对双方的战略联盟，我感到非常激动，很期待和夏普所有人合作，我们有很多共同努力奋斗的目标亟待实现。我深信，我们将共同开发出夏普深藏的潜力，一起面对挑战与突破。”
