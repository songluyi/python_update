French President Francois Hollande has declared what he called "a state of economic emergency" and says it's time to redefine France's economic and social model, unveiling a 2-billion-euro plan to revive hiring.
Hollande laid out a series of proposed economic measures Monday in an annual speech to business leaders to boost long-stagnant French growth and reduce chronic unemployment.
