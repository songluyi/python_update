Tesla founder and chief executive Elon Musk says pre-orders of the firm's much-anticipated Model 3 electric car currently total 276,000.
Such has been the interest that Mr Musk tweeted the company was "definitely going to need to rethink production planning". Mr Musk has said his goal is to produce about 500,000 vehicles a year once production is at full capacity.
