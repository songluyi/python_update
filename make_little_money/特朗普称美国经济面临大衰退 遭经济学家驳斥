Some economists are pushing back against Donald Trump's comments that the U.S. is headed toward a "massive recession," calling the New York real estate developer's assertions "unfounded" and flat-out wrong.
Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York, told Reuters, "We're not heading for a recession, massive or minor, and the unemployment rate is not 20 percent."
