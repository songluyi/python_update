E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said on Wednesday that it would continue to make more investments to boost its presence in rural areas.
"Modernization of agriculture is key to China's economic growth in the next two decades," Ma said. "Making full use of the Internet, including big data, to help farmers out of poverty is a smart strategy."
