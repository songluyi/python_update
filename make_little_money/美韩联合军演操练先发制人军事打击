The United States and South Korea will reportedly practice preemptive military strikes to take out North Korean nuclear sites next month when they begin the largest joint exercises ever conducted by the two allied forces.
美国和韩国下个月开始举行两个盟军之间有史以来最大规模的联合军演，据报将演练先发制人摧毁朝鲜核设施的军事打击能力。
In the wake of North Korea’s recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launch, Washington and Seoul will focus in part on defending against attacks by weapons of mass destruction during this year's annual joint exercises.
继朝鲜最近进行核试验和远程火箭发射之后，华盛顿和首尔今年的年度联合军演将部分努力集中于如何抵御大规模杀伤性武器的袭击。
In some scenarios being game planned by military strategists, the best defense is a good offense, one that would eliminate a North Korean missile site, nuclear facility or other strategic military target prior to an imminent attack.
在军事战略家设计的某些演习状况中，最好的防守就是发动有效进攻，也就是在袭击即将来临之前，摧毁朝鲜的导弹发射场、核设施或其他军事战略目标。
“These types of exercises, this type of training, considering the nature of the threat, it's going to be the new normal for North Korea, unless they were to roll back their nuclear program, which I don'foresee that happening anytime soon,” said Northeast Asia security analyst Daniel Pinkston with Troy University in Seoul.
首尔的特洛伊大学安全分析人士丹尼尔·平斯顿说：“考虑到威胁的性质，这类军演和这类训练对朝鲜来说将是新常态，除非他们废止其核计划。但我认为短期内这不会发生。”
