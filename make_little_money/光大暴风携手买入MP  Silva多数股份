China is set to deepen its investment in global sports and entertainment with the acquisition of a majority stake in MP & Silva in a deal valuing the Italian-owned media rights agency at just over $1bn.
随着收购意大利人所有的媒体转播权代理机构MP & Silva的多数股份，中国将扩大对全球体育和娱乐业的投资。这宗交易对MP & Silva的估值略高于10亿美元。
China Everbright, a financial services company, and Beijing Baofeng Technology, a listed online video group, will acquire a stake of more than 60 per cent in MP & Silva, according to two people involved in the process. A deal is expected to be announced within in the next 48 hours, although the timing could slip.
据两名参与相关流程的人士称，金融服务性企业中国光大(China Everbright)和上市在线视频集团北京暴风科技(Beijing Baofeng Technology)将收购MP & Silva逾60%的股份。这宗交易预计会在48小时内公布，尽管具体的公布时间可能会有出入。
China Everbright is a large state conglomerate that, like many of its peers, is seeking to diversity abroad as its domestic banking arm contends with ever slower economic growth at home.
光大是一家大型国有集团。与许多同类企业类似，在光大的国内银行部门艰难应对国内经济增长放缓之际，该集团也在寻求到海外实现多元化发展。
Baofeng was one of China’s hottest stocks before the country’s markets crashed last year, with its share price rising 3,300 per cent in the three months to June 2015.
在中国股市去年崩盘之前，暴风科技曾是中国最热门的股票之一，其股价在截至2015年6月的三个月中上涨了33倍。
MP & Silva was established about a decade ago and makes 80 per cent of its money from selling football rights, but also sells the French Open in Europe and Formula One in the Middle East.
MP & Silva成立于大约十年前，该公司赚的钱有80%来自于出售足球比赛的转播权，不过该公司还在欧洲出售法国网球公开赛(French Open)的转播权，在中东出售一级方程式赛车(Formula One)的转播权。
The company had revenues of around $600m in 2014-15, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of just under $60m.
2014-15财年，该公司营收约6亿美元，息税折旧及摊销前利润(Ebitda)略低于6000万美元。
MP & Silva declined to comment. Everbright and Baofeng could not immediately be reached for comment.
MP & Silva拒绝置评。记者未能立即联系上光大和暴风科技请其置评。
