India's Supreme Court has rejected an appeal to keep a young man in prison. He was one of six males who brutally raped a young woman in 2012.
印度最高法院驳回了要求继续监禁一名年轻男子的上诉。2012年，六名男子野蛮强奸一名年轻女性，这名男子是其中一人。
The court said Monday "Under the present law, detention cannot be extended beyond three years."
法院星期一说，依照现行法律，拘禁期不能超过三年。
Five of the men were sent to prison, but the youngest, who was 17 at the time, was sent to a correctional facility for three years; the maximum term allowed under Indian law.
其他五名男子已被判刑，但这名年轻男子犯案时只有17岁，所以被送入教养所拘禁三年，按照印度法律，三年是教养拘禁的最长期限。
The Delhi Commission for Women filed the petition to keep the young man, who is now 20, in custody.
德里保护女性权益委员会提出上诉，要求继续拘禁这名现年20岁的男子。
DCW wrote in its petition the Indian government has not submitted any material "to establish that the mental state of the respondent has been reformed . . .the respondent continues to have criminal/perverse bent of mind which poses a serious threat to women."
该委员会在上诉书中说，印度政府并未提出任何证据来表明这名男子的心理状态已得到转变，而罪恶扭曲的心理状态将使其继续对女性构成严重威胁。
