China's vast southern regions are expected to experience blizzards, sleet and rainfall from Wednesday to Saturday, the National Meteorological Center said.
A strong cold front will sweep out of the northeast toward southern coastal provinces, with temperatures dropping by as much as 14 degrees, approaching the coldest recorded in January in the past 30 years, the center said.
