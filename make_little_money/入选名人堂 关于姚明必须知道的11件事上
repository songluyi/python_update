Yao Ming, the retired 7-foot-6 center, who spent his entire nine-year NBA career with the Houston Rockets, has been elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. An induction ceremony will be held Sept. 9 in Springfield, Massachusetts.
When the Rockets selected Yao with the first pick of the 2002 NBA draft, it marked the fifth time in franchise history that the team made the No. 1 overall selection. Elvin Hayes (1968), Ralph Sampson (1983) and Hakeem Olajuwon (1984) preceded Yao into the Hall of Fame. The Rockets also selected John Lucas with the No. 1 overall selection in 1976.
In his NBA debut, Yao played 11 minutes off the bench in a season-opening 91-82 road loss to the Indiana Pacers on Oct. 30, 2002. He grabbed two rebounds but didn't score, missing his only field-goal attempt. "I learned that I still have a lot to learn, and I'm just a rookie," Yao said through an interpreter. "It's a very long road. ... I didn't feel good to sit on the bench and watch my teammates losing. Of course, I want to contribute."
Most points in regular season: 41 versus Atlanta, Feb. 22, 2002.
The first meeting between Yao and Shaquille O'Neal -- No. 1 overall picks drafted 10 years apart -- stands as one of the most eagerly anticipated individual matchups in NBA history. Yao blocked O'Neal's first three shots and totaled 10 points, 10 rebounds and 6 blocks, as Houston earned a 108-104 overtime win. O'Neal racked up 31 points and 13 rebounds. Steve Francis scored 44 points for Houston. Kobe Bryant fell one assist shy of a triple-double but shot 5-for-21 from the field.
Yao began his professional career at age 17 with Shanghai of the Chinese Basketball Association and won a championship in 2001-02, his final season in that league. He also led the Sharks to championship series appearances in 2000 and 2001. Years after moving on to the NBA, Yao rescued his former team from financial peril by purchasing the franchise in 2009.
