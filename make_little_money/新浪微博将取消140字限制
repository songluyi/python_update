Sina Weibo will remove its 140-character limit starting Jan. 28 on its developer platform, its CEO confirmed on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, a snapshot of a letter from Weibo Open Platform to its developers was widely circulated on Weibo, where it said the new format is expected to be tested among "senior users" from Jan. 28 and open to all users by Feb. 28.
