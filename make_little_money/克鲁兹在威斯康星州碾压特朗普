 Ted Cruz has convincingly beaten Donald Trump in the Republican primary in Wisconsin, raising the odds that the party’s presidential nominee will be decided at a contested convention in Cleveland.
 在威斯康星州的共和党初选中，特德•克鲁兹(Ted Cruz)令人信服地击败了唐纳德•特朗普(Donald Trump)，这一结果加大了在克利夫兰“僵局代表大会”(contested convention)上确定该党总统候选人提名的可能性。
 The Associated Press projected that the Texas senator would win Wisconsin state, which was holding Republican and Democratic primaries on Tuesday. With seven per cent of the vote counted, the conservative senator had won 49 per cent of the ballots, compared to 35 per cent for Mr Trump and 14 per cent for Ohio governor John Kasich.
 根据美联社(Associated Press)的预期，得克萨斯州参议员克鲁兹将赢得威斯康星州的初选。在统计了90%的选票后，这位保守派参议员的得票率为49%，而特朗普的得票率为35%，俄亥俄州州长约翰•卡西奇(John Kasich)得票率为14%。周二，威斯康星州举行了共和党和民主党的初选。
 The victory means that Mr Cruz has won nine of the 31 states where Republicans have voted in the 2016 race. Mr Trump leads with 20 states, while Mr Kasich lags behind his rivals with only one success, in his home state of Ohio.
 这场胜利意味着，在2016年的初选选战中，克鲁兹在共和党已投过票的31个州中拿下了9个州。领跑的特朗普拿下了20个州，卡西奇则只拿下了自己所在的俄亥俄州。
 Mr Trump has a significant lead in the delegate race even after Mr Cruz’s win in Wisconsin. But his loss in the Badger State raises the prospects that the tycoon will struggle to win the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination on the first vote at the convention in July.
 即便在克鲁兹拿下威斯康星州之后，特朗普在党代表票数方面仍有显著的领先优势。不过，特朗普在“獾州”（威斯康星州的别名——译者注）的失利引出了这样一种可能性：这位富豪将很难在7月份共和党代表大会的首轮投票中赢得获得提名所需的1237张党代表票。
