Chinese citizens have reacted with anger and alarm at news of a massive illegal vaccine operation uncovered in Shandong province. The illegal vaccine ring involved hundreds of people, and affected 24 provinces and cities, local media said.
Though authorities had known about the ring since April last year, they only made the news public late on last Friday when they issued a call demanding that suppliers come forward to help them trace potential victims.
