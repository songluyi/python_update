At least 21 people died when gunmen armed with grenades and Kalashnikovs attacked a university in Pakistan Wednesday.
Police, soldiers and special forces swarmed the university from the ground and the air to try to shut down the assault. Television images showed female students running for their lives and witnesses reported at least two explosions.
