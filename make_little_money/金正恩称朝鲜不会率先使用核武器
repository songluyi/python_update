Kim Jong Un made a major declaration during North Korea's seventh congress of the Workers' Party: His country would only use nuclear weapons if its sovereignty came under threat from another nuclear power, the government press agency reported.
It's important to note that North Korea has pledged in the past that it would "never use nuclear weapons first." It has also sought negotiations with the U.S. and others over its nuclear program.
