The NBA has been celebrating Kobe Bryant since his announcement last month that he is retiring after this season – his 20th in the league. But former NBA player Stephon Marbury says China's basketball fans would far exceed the adulation Bryant is receiving in the NBA if he were to wrap up his career in the Chinese Basketball Association.
Marbury and Bryant are the only two members of the storied 1996 NBA draft class – which included Allen Iverson, Ray Allen, Peja Stojakovic, Steve Nash, – who are still playing professionally. Bryant regularly takes off-season promotional trips to China and was the most popular member of the gold-medal-winning U.S. team at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
