 An investor consortium led by China’s Anbang Insurance has lost the bidding war for Starwood Hotels & Resorts, after failing to demonstrate that it had the financing in place to back up its latest $14bn offer, according to a person directly involved.
 中国安邦保险集团(Anbang Insurance)牵头的投资者财团，已在竞购喜达屋酒店及度假村国际集团(Starwood Hotels & Resorts)的大战中败下阵来。据一位直接参与相关事宜的人士表示，该财团未能证明其已备好履行140亿美元最新收购要约所需的资金。
 As a result, Starwood is set to confirm its previously agreed cash and stock deal with Marriott International as soon as later on Thursday, two people close to the matter said.
 喜达屋对此作出了回应，它确认了早先与美国同行万豪国际(Marriott International)达成的现金加股票交易。万豪成功收购喜达屋——按周四收盘价算，收购对价为133亿美元——将创造出世界上最大的酒店集团，旗下将拥有超过5500家酒店、110万间客房。
 In a statement on Thursday evening, the Anbang-led group said: “Due to various market considerations, the consortium has determined not to proceed further.”
 安邦牵头的财团周四晚发布声明称，出于多方面的市场考虑，该财团决定不再继续推进对喜达屋的收购。
 It thanked Starwood’s management and advisors for their support through the process, adding that the company had “met many of our acquisition criteria, including the ability to generate consistent, long-term returns over time.”
 该财团对喜达屋管理层和顾问在整个收购过程中给予的支持表示了感谢，并补充称喜达屋“满足了我们的许多收购标准，包括未来产生持续、长期回报的能力”。
 The end of Anbang’s pursuit of Starwood marks the sharpest setback for Chinese bidder who have accounted for a record share of global merger and acquisition activity in 2016.
 安邦放弃竞购喜达屋标志着中国企业在并购领域遭遇的最大一场挫败。2016年以来，中国企业在全球并购交易中所占的份额已创下了纪录。
 It also risks reviving long-held questions in the minds of sellers and their advisors about the seriousness of some Chinese suitors. Anbang’s consortium had shared no details in public about the sources of its financing, and offered no comment on Thursday about whether it had fully funded its offer.
 全球卖家和他们的顾问长期以来对一些中国买家是否抱着严肃态度怀有疑问，安邦此举将再次勾起他们心中的疑虑。安邦牵头的财团从未公开透露其资金来源，周四也只字未提其是否已为收购喜达屋备好充足资金。
