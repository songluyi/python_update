China is opposed to the nuclear test and satellite launch by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and supports efforts at the UN Security Council to pass a new and forceful resolution as soon as possible, said Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui on Tuesday. He made the remark after talks with ROK First Vice-Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam in Seoul.
The Chinese vice foreign minister said it is in the interests of both countries to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and maintain peace and stability there.
