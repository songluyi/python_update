1.You never really know how much the people around you are hurting. You could be standing next to someone who is completely broken inside and you wouldn’t even know it. So never deprive someone of hope; it might be all they have. And remember that there are two ways to spread light in this world: You can either be a flame of hope, or a mirror that reflects it. Be one of the two every chance you get.
1.你永远也不知道身边的人正在遭受怎样的痛苦。你可能正站在他们身边，可是你甚至不知道他们的内心已经支离破碎。所以永远不要剥夺别人的希望，那可能是他们的所有。还要记住，有两种方法能够在这个世界传播光明：你可以是希望之光，或者是反射希望之光的镜子。只要有机会，就去成为两者之一吧。
2.The more you give, the more you receive is a universal truth that applies to way more than charitable giving. It literally applies to everything. It has been described as the boomerang effect and that term is very fitting because you literally get back everything you put out there. It doesn’t matter if it is kindness, generosity, love, anger, frustration, money, etc. It all comes right back to you.
2.“你付出得越多，收获得越多”不只适用于慈善捐献，还是一句普遍真理，它确实适用于每件事。这被称为“反向效应”，相当贴切，因为你确实能够收获所有你付出的东西。无所谓它是什么，不论是好意、慷慨、爱心、怒火、挫折、金钱以及其他，最终都会回报与你。
