The Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) will undergo sweeping changes this year. The overhauled SAT exam, which puts a heavier emphasis on reading comprehension and tests students on their real-world applications, may affect the performance of Chinese students, who have traditionally excelled in the math part of the test and relied heavily on rote memorization.
Students will earn points for the questions they answer correctly but will not lose points for incorrect answers, as they did on the old test.
