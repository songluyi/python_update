Most 9-year-olds are trying to keep up in the mile run in gym class. Milla Bizzotto, on the other hand, just crushed a race designed by U.S. Navy SEALs for ultra-fit adults.
"I just don't want people to quit because they don't believe in themselves," Milla told CBS Miami. Her father (and coach) says that Milla had been bullied in school but that the trouble stopped once she started training and gained confidence. "I think the bullying thing has died down without her having to take physical action, just because her outlook is so much different now that she knows how to defend herself," he said.
