The United Nations now says at least 25 people were killed and some 120 wounded in last month's attack on a U.N. civilian shelter in Malakal, South Sudan.
联合国说，位于南苏丹马拉卡尔的联合国平民避难所上月遇袭事件造成至少25人死亡，约120人受伤。
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) updated its toll Friday, two weeks after the February 17 and 18 ordeal at the camp where some 47,000 people have taken refuge from South Sudan's ongoing civil war.
联合国人道事务协调办公室星期五公布了新的伤亡数字。两周前，收容约4万7000名南苏丹内战难民的联合国避难所于2月17日和18日发生袭击惨案。
OCHA says humanitarian partners have "rapidly mobilized" staff and supplies to tend to the additional needs at the camp since the attack. The report says in addition to the 25 dead and 120 wounded, some 3,700 families' shelters were destroyed or damaged in addition to clinics, water tankers, nutrition centers and schools.

OCHA also said there are "credible reports" of armed men from Sudan's People's Liberation Army entering the camp and firing on civilians during the two-day siege.
联合国人道事务协调办公室还说，有“可靠报告”说，在两天围困期间，苏丹人民解放军的武装人员曾进入难民营，向平民开枪。
