Last Wednesday morning, issues of Captain America: Steve Rogers #1 revealed the patriotic hero has secretly been a deep-cover agent of nefarious global terrorist organization HYDRA the whole time. Yes, that HYDRA â€” the ostensible villain of all three Marvel cinematic universe movies bearing the captain's name, and his oldest enemy in the comics (other than possibly Nazi Germany).
Of course, this is the comic book industry, so in a few weeks or months there's a solid possibility the captain's supposed double-cross will be revealed as mind control, an alternate timeline or some other narrative tomfoolery.
