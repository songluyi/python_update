With the Houston Rockets' season finally over after a 114-81 loss to the Golden State Warriors, the truth was finally uttered in the locker room.
Dwight Howard, potentially playing his last game with the Rockets, finished with eight points and 21 meaningless rebounds, missing 10 of 13 shots. Trevor Ariza, dreadful in this series, missed 7 of 8 shots, including all seven of his 3-point attempts. Jason Terry, the man who guaranteed a victory in Game 5, missed all seven of his shots.
