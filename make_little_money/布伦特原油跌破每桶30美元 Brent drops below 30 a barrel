Whoooossshhh.
嗖嗖嗖。
That’s the sound of Brent crude, the global oil marker, falling below $30 a barrel for the first time since April 2004.
这是全球原油基准布伦特原油(Brent crude)自2004年4月以来首次跌破每桶30美元时发出的声音。
Brent, which started the day in the red only to climb as much as 3.4 per cent, fell 2.8 per cent to $29.99 in late afternoon trading.
早盘还攀升多达3.4%的布兰特原油价格尾盘下跌了2.8%，报收于29.99美元/桶。
Crude’s slide comes after the latest weekly report from the US Energy Information Administration showed inventories of crude at Cushing, a key delivery point, climbed to a record high and gasoline and distillate inventories rose more than expected.
此番原油价格下滑之前，美国能源情报署(US Energy Information Administration)最新的周报显示，关键交割地点——俄克拉何马州库欣(Cushing)的原油库存已升至创纪录高位，汽油和馏分油库存增加超出预期。
The news also prompted West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, to give up its gains for the day.
这一消息还使美国石油基准西德克萨斯中质原油(West Texas Intermediate)失去当日之前的涨幅。
A glut of supply that has prompted crude to fall more than 70 per cent since mid 2014 has been exacerbated this year amid rising concerns about the health of the Chinese economy and strength in the US dollar.
