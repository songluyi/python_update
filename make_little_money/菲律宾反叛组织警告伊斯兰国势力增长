The leader of the main Muslim rebel group fighting for autonomy in the southern Philippines warns the Islamic State could soon gain the upper hand in establishing a foothold in the region.
为争取在菲律宾南部实行自治而战斗的主要穆斯林反叛组织领导人警告说，伊斯兰国不久就会在该地区建立据点的行动中占据上风。
Murad Ebrahim, who chairs the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), told reporters in Kuala Lumpur Monday the extremist group could take advantage of the frustrations of Muslims in the southern region of Mindanao over the legislature's failure to ratify a peace deal reached between his group and President Benigno Aquino's administration in 2014.
摩罗伊斯兰解放阵线首领艾布拉希姆星期一在吉隆坡对记者说，菲律宾议会拒绝批准该组织与阿基诺政府在2014年达成的和平协议，而伊斯兰国可能会利用棉兰老地区的穆斯林因此而产生的不满情绪。
The deal, which was brokered by Malaysia, would grant minority Muslims greater autonomy in exchange for ending a four-decade-old insurgency that has claimed well over 100,000 lives.
在马来西亚斡旋下达成的和平协议规定，穆斯林少数族裔可以享有更大自治权，作为交换条件，摩罗伊斯兰解放阵线将结束持续40年的反叛活动。这期间有10万多人死于武装冲突。
Ebrahim said the MILF will not abandon its armed struggle for an autonomous homeland, but says it will not revert to violence so long as the peace process has a chance to succeed.
艾布拉希姆说，摩罗伊斯兰解放阵线不会放弃争取自治家园的武装斗争，但只要和平进程还存在成功的希望，该组织就不会重走暴力之路。
