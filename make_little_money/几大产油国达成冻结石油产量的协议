Qatar’s energy minister said the world’s big oil producer countries had reached a conditional agreement to freeze production at January levels.
卡塔尔能源与工业大臣穆罕默德本萨利赫萨达(Mohammed Bin Saleh al-Sada)表示，全球大型产油国已达成有条件协议，将把石油产量冻结在今年1月的水平。
Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada said the provisional deal, announced after a meeting of oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar, would be contingent on major producers following suit, reports Anjli Raval, the FT’s Oil & Gas Correspondent.
该协议是在沙特阿拉伯、俄罗斯、委内瑞拉和卡塔尔主管石油的部长举行会议后宣布的。萨达表示，这一临时性协议能否取得成功，将取决于主要产油国是否跟进。
“We believe this step will stabilise the market,” he said, according to Reuters.
据路透社(Reuters)报道，萨达表示：“我们相信此举将会稳定石油市场。”
In a news conference in Doha after the meeting, Ali Al Naimi, the Kingdom’s powerful oil minister, said the meeting was successful. Since global supply is already declining as a result of current prices, a freeze in output at levels from the start of the year was “adequate” for the market, he told reporters.
在上述会议后于多哈召开的新闻发布会上，沙特实权在握的石油部长阿里纳伊米(Ali Al-Naimi)表示，这次会议是成功的。他告诉记者，由于全球石油供应已因当前的油价而处在下滑当中，将石油产量冻结在年初的水平“足以”稳定住市场。
Venezuela’s oil minister said he would meet his counterparts from Iran and Iraq on Wednesday.
委内瑞拉石油部长表示，自己会在周三与伊朗和伊拉克主管石油的部长举行会晤。
Although the decision will be welcomed by some in the oil market, others have pointed to the fact that many Opec producers are pumping at full capacity already.
虽然这一协议会受到石油市场部分人士的欢迎，但也有一些人指出，许多欧佩克(OPEC)国家其实已经在以最大产能生产石油了。
Mr Naimi said he hoped producer countries inside and outside Opec would adopt this proposal. He added “We will assess in [the] next few months the next steps to stabilise [the] market.”
纳伊米表示，他希望欧佩克内外的产油国能够接受这一协议。他补充说：“我们将在今后几个月评估稳定市场的后续举措。”
