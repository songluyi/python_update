 Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook chief executive, warned the world against turning inwards, including building walls, blocking free expression and reducing trade and immigration, in his most politically charged speech to date.
 Facebook首席执行官马克•扎克伯格(Mark Zuckerberg)发表了他迄今政治色彩最浓的演讲，提醒世界各国不要自我封闭，比如修筑高墙、抑制言论自由以及限制贸易和移民。
 Speaking at Facebook’s annual developer conference in San Francisco, Mr Zuckerberg said the path was to connect more, not less, and to prioritise “hope over fear”. He lashed out against isolationists, in comments that could be read as criticism of US presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has a controversial plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico.
 扎克伯格在旧金山Facebook年度开发者大会上发表演讲时表示，正确的道路是加强、而不是减少连通，并把希望摆在恐惧前面。他大力抨击了孤立主义者，他的这些话可能会被解读为对美国总统竞选人唐纳德•特朗普(Donald Trump)的批评。后者提出了一个备受争议的计划，即沿美墨边境修筑一道墙。
 “We are one global community,” he said. “Whether we are welcoming a refugee fleeing war or an immigrant seeking opportunity, coming together to fight a global disease like Ebola or to address climate change.”
 “我们是一个全球性的社区，”扎克伯格说，“不论我们是在欢迎逃离战火的难民或寻找机遇的移民，还是在携手对抗像埃博拉(Ebola)这样的全球性疾病或应对气候变化，情况都是如此。”
 Facebook defines its mission as connecting the world. Mr Zuckerberg has been increasingly meeting with world leaders, including Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, as he pursues a plan to expand the internet to the billions who do not yet have it.
 Facebook将自身使命定义为连通全球。扎克伯格近来越来越多地与全球各国领导人展开会晤，其中包括印度总理纳伦德拉•莫迪(Narendra Modi)。扎克伯格正在实施一项计划，打算拓展互联网、覆盖数十亿尚未联网的人。
 At home, he has long pursued a relaxation of US immigration rules, both for the highly skilled employees whom Facebook wants to import and the lower skilled workers who have lived in the US as illegal immigrants for years through an organisation called FWD.US.
 在美国国内，扎克伯格长期以来一直在通过一个名为FWD.US的组织推动官方放松美国的移民规定，这既包括针对Facebook想引进的高技能人才的规定，也包括针对以非法移民身份多年待在美国的低技能劳工的规定。
