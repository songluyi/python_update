Risks associated with margin trading that allow investors to borrow money for stock purchases are well under control, the capital market regulator said on Friday, soothing investors' nerves after the A-share market suffered its biggest monthly loss in nearly eight years.
Meanwhile, major shareholders of listed companies sold shares worth about 7.47 billion yuan between January 9 and January 28, only accounting for 20 percent of the total share value sold during the same period of last year.
