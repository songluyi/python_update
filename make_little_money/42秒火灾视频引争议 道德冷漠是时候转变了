The 42-second video, filmed by Li (pseudonym) on April 14 in the Huadu district of Guangzhou, shows a man crying for help while he stands trapped in a burning building behind a barred window, the Beijing-based Legal Daily newspaper reported Saturday.
Li later argued that he had tried to save the man in the video but failed because he was too far away to reach the man in time.
