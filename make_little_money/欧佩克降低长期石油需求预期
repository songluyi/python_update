The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has lowered its long-term estimates for oil demand but says $10tn of investment will still be needed between now and 2040 to cover future needs and prevent a spike in prices.
石油输出国组织（OPEC，简称欧佩克）降低了长期石油需求预期，但表示，从现在到2040年将需要10万亿美元投资才能满足未来需求和阻止价格飙涨。
The forecasts, contained in the group’s World Oil Outlook, highlight the delicate balancing act facing Opec and its most powerful member Saudi Arabia as it persists with a strategy that puts long-term exports and market share over short-term financial gain.
欧佩克在其《世界能源展望》(World Energy Outlook)中做出了上述预期，突显出该集团及其实力最强大的成员国沙特面临微妙的平衡，沙特正推行将长期出口和市场份额置于短期财务收益之上的战略。
Lower spending by major companies and oil prices at below $40 a barrel for a prolonged period could have an impact on future oil supplies and lead to a surge in prices.
大型石油公司降低支出，以及石油价格长期低于每桶40美元，可能对未来石油供应产生影响，导致价格飙升。
“If the right signals are not forthcoming, there is a possibility that the market could find that there is not enough new capacity and infrastructure in place to meet future rising demand levels, and this would obviously have a knock-on impact on prices,” said Abdalla El-Badri, secretary-general of Opec, in the report.
欧佩克秘书长阿卜杜拉巴德里(Abdalla El-Badri)在报告中表示：“如果正确的信号没有出现，那么市场很可能发现，缺乏足够的新产能和基础设施来满足未来不断增长的需求水平，这显然会对价格产生连锁影响。”
