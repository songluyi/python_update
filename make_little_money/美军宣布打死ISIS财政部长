The US military said on Thursday that it had killed the “financial minister” of Isis and two other senior officials.
美国军方周四表示，已打死“伊拉克和黎凡特伊斯兰国”(ISIS)的“财政部长”和另外两名高官。
Colonel Steve Warren, spokesman for the US-led coalition, said that a November airstrike had killed Abu Salah who he described as “one of the most senior and experienced members of [Isis’s] financial network”.
以美国为首的联军发言人史蒂夫茠伦上校(Colonel Steve Warren)表示，11月的一次空袭导致阿布萨拉赫(Abu Salah)被打死，他称此人是“（ISIS）金融网络中级别最高且最有经验的成员之一”。
A former Al-Qaeda member, Abu Salah was the third senior Isis financial official to be killed in the past three months, Col Warren said. Two other senior Isis members who were involved in extortion activities — named by the Pentagon as Abu Maryam and Abu Wakman al-Tunisi — were also killed, he said.
沃伦上校表示，萨拉赫是前基地组织(Al-Qaeda)成员，他是过去3个月被打死的第三位ISIS金融高官。他表示，另外两名曾参与敲诈活动的ISIS高级成员也被打死，美国国防部公布这二人的名字是阿布马里亚姆(Abu Maryam)和阿布瓦克曼埃尔-突尼斯(Abu Wakman al-Tunisi)。
According to a report by the Brookings Institution, Abu Salah’s real name was Muafaq Mustafa Mohammed al-Karmoush.
根据布鲁金斯学会(Brookings Institution)的一份报告，阿布萨拉赫的真名是穆法克穆斯塔法穆罕默德埃尔-卡莫什(Muafaq Mustafa Mohammed al-Karmoush)。
The Pentagon announced the airstrikes as the US Treasury said that a significant part of the $500m that Isis had earned from oil sales came from trade with the Assad regime.
在美国国防部宣布空袭行动之际，美国财政部表示，在ISIS从石油销售中获得的5亿美元收入中，有很大一部分是从与阿萨德政权(Assad)的贸易中获得的。
Adam Szubin, acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said that Isis had looted between $500m and $1bn from bank vaults it captured in Iraq and Syria and was gaining “many millions more” from extorting local populations.
美国财政部负责反恐和金融情报的代理副部长亚当舒宾(Adam Szubin)表示，ISIS从伊拉克和叙利亚缴获的银行保险库中掠夺了5亿美元至10亿美元，同时利用敲诈当地人口获得“数百万”美元。
