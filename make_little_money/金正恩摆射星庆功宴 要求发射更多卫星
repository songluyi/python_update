North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has promised to put more satellites in space, even as the international community prepares to punish his regime over a long-range rocket launch just last week.
North Korea sparked international anger last week with the launch of the Kwangmyongsong-4 satellite, which came just a month after its fourth nuclear test. The launch, which most in the international community viewed as a disguised ballistic missile test, violated multiple UN resolutions banning the nuclear-armed country from the use of ballistic technology.
