 A piece of aircraft debris that washed up on a sandbank in Mozambique has a “high possibility” of being from a Boeing 777, the same type of jet as the missing Malaysian airliner MH370, according to Malaysia’s transport minister.
 据马来西亚交通部长廖中莱(Liow Tiong Lai)表示，在莫桑比克的一片沙滩上发现了一块飞机碎片，“非常可能”来自波音777——与马来西亚失踪客机MH370为同种机型。
 Liow Tiong Lai said the debris would be taken to Australia for further examination and it was not yet possible to determine if it was from the Malaysia Airlines aircraft that went missing on a flight between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing almost two years ago.
 廖中莱表示，这块碎片会被带到澳大利亚做进一步检查，目前尚无法确定这块碎片是否来自近两年前在吉隆坡到北京的航线上消失的马航MH370客机。
 The disappearance on March 8 2014 of the aircraft with 239 people on board has prompted the largest and most expensive search effort in aviation history.
 这架客机于2014年3月8日失踪，机上载有239人。它的失踪推动了航空史上规模最大、金额最高的搜寻活动。
 In August a piece of a Boeing 777 wing known as a flaperon washed up on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion and was subsequently confirmed by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak as belonging to MH370. But an undersea search of a remote part of the ocean off Western Australia has failed to find the final resting place of the aircraft and is due to wind up within months.
 去年8月一块波音777机翼碎片（确定为襟副翼）冲上了印度洋法属留尼汪岛(La Réunion)，随后获马来西亚总理纳吉布•拉扎克(Najib Razak)确认属于MH370。但在对远离西澳大利亚海岸的一片偏远海域进行海底搜索后，未能发现MH370的最后沉落处，此次搜索活动将在数月内结束。
 Only four other 777s have been written off due to accidents since the aircraft type entered service in 1994. None of those was lost over the sea and all are accounted for.
 波音777机型自1994年投入使用以来，只有5架飞机整机失事。其他4架都不是在海上失踪的，而且都已确定下落。
 “The location reported to be found in Mozambique is consistent with the drift modelling that was undertaken,” said a spokesman for the Australia’s Air Transport Safety Board, which is co-ordinating the undersea search. “But until the debris has been examined we cannot comment on its nature.”
 澳大利亚交通安全局(ATSB)目前负责海底搜索的统筹工作，其发言人表示：“报道中莫桑比克的发现位置与此前的漂移建模保持一致。但我们要对这块碎片进行检查后才能对其性质发表评论。”
