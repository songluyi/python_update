Iraqi forces on Sunday captured a government complex in central Ramadi, a predominantly Sunni city, forcing the withdrawal of Isis fighters.
伊拉克政府军周日攻占了逊尼派(Sunni)占人口多数的拉马迪市中心一个政府大院，迫使“伊拉克和黎凡特伊斯兰国”(ISIS)作战人员撤离。
The complex has been an Isis stronghold and its fall to government forces comes weeks after soldiers encircled the site and marked a significant victory that could pave the way to the recapture of the city, analysts said.
分析人士表示，这个大院一直是ISIS的据点，它在被政府军包围数周之后终于落入政府军手中，这标志着一个重大胜利，可能为夺回拉马迪市铺平道路。
State television broadcast footage of troops, Humvee vehicles and tanks advancing through Ramadi streets amid piles of rubble and collapsed houses. Some districts appeared to have been completely destroyed by the advance.
官方电视台播出的视频画面显示，步兵、悍马车和坦克在拉马迪街道成堆的瓦砾和倒塌房屋之间向前推进。部分地段似乎已被这场攻势完全破坏。
The city, the capital of Anbar province to the west of Baghdad, fell under Isis control in May after government troops fled in a defeat that prompted Washington to rethink its strategy against the militants.
拉马迪是巴格达以西的安巴尔省的省会，它在今年5月政府军溃败逃离后落入ISIS手中，那次溃败促使美国政府反思其针对ISIS武装分子的战略。
Iraqi sources told the Financial Times that the latest operation by Iraqi forces — which included counter-terrorism forces and different army divisions — marks a success for the government and could pave the way to the eventual fall of Ramadi.
伊拉克消息人士向英国《金融时报》表示，伊拉克军队（包括反恐部队和来自几个陆军师的部队）发起的最新战役标志着政府取得一个成功，并可能为最终夺回拉马迪铺平道路。
“The Iraqi forces entered the complex a few hours ago and did not face any opposition from Isis. This shows that Isis withdrew to the north-east of Ramadi,” said Sajad Jiyad, an Iraq analyst.
伊拉克分析人士萨贾德吉亚德(Sajad Jiyad)表示：“伊拉克部队在几小时攻入这个大院，并未遭遇ISIS任何抵抗。这表明ISIS已撤至拉马迪东北部。”
“This is of course considered an achievement for the Iraqi forces given that there had been questions as to whether the forces, Iraqi police and army, can take control of the situation through ground operations and resist Isis,” Mr Jiyad added.
