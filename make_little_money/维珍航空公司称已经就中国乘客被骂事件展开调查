Virgin Atlantic has promised to look into the case in which a Chinese passenger was verbally abused by a white passenger and one flight attendant while flying from London to Shanghai on March 1, 2016.
According to the post, Liu has to seek help from other passengers before the flight attendant came, while the man kept using the f word and all other discriminative words behind her back. "A British man and his Chinese wife decided they could not have it anymore and stepped up to stop him, but they were threatened by the man," Liu said.
