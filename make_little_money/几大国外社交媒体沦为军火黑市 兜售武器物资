A study by the Small Arms Survey and the Armament Research Services (ARES) revealed a growing number of arms trades made online in Libya. Facebook, WhatsApp and other social media sites and apps are becoming online black markets for weapons.
And it's not just small arms that are sold online. The study, first reported by the New York Times, found sales of heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, grenade launchers, anti-tank guided weapons and portable air defense systems.
