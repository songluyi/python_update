Venezuela's Supreme Court has ruled that President Nicolas Maduro's request for special powers to stave off an economic emergency is legal, despite criticism from the country's legislature.
委内瑞拉最高法院做出裁决，认定马杜罗总统申请特别权力，以防止发生经济危机的要求是合法的。不过，委内瑞拉议会对马杜罗的这一举动提出了批评。
The court ruled Thursday that Maduro's decree granting the president expanded authority over the economy for 60 days is legitimate. The court said opposition lawmakers did not follow the correct procedures for opposing the measure.
委内瑞拉最高法院星期四说，马杜罗发布政令，在60天内扩大总统在经济领域的权限，这种做法符合法律的规定。法院表示，反对派议员没有遵守抵制这项举措的正当程序。
Maduro had asked the court for emergency powers to counteract the country's deep economic crisis by taking over the resources of private companies, imposing currency controls, and using "other social, economic, or political measures deemed fitting."
马杜罗要求最高法院授予他紧急权力，接管私有公司资源，实施货币管制，并采用“其他被认为恰当的社会、经济和政治措施”，以遏制不断深化的经济危机。
The government says the move is an attempt to stimulate production, but the opposition accuses the government of extending the reach of its power too far.
委内瑞拉政府说，采取这一举措是为了刺激生产，但反对派指责政府过份扩大权限。
