China's greenhouse gas emissions are likely to peak by 2030 or perhaps earlier, taking into account the needs of industrialization and urbanization, the country's special representative on climate change said on Monday.
But Xie said he has noted that several agencies have recently issued reports concluding that the global emission of carbon dioxide has stopped growing because of a weak world economy and efforts taken by many countries in 2015, and that China was a major factor.
