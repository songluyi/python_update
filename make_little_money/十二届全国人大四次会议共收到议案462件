Lawmakers have filed 462 motions to the secretariat of the fourth session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC), an official said Sunday.
Last year, 522 motions were filed. Since NPC deputies were first tasked with raising motions at the annual session in 1983, the number increased sharply from 61 in that year to a peak of 1,374 in 2004. It has remained around 500 since 2005.
