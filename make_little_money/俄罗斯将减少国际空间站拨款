Russian media say the government plans to cut the amount of money it spends on the International Space Station during the next decade.
俄罗斯媒体报道说，俄罗斯政府计划削减在未来10年内用于国际空间站的开支。
The Izvestiya daily reports the latest budget drafts for 2016-25 include about $3.3 billion in spending on the station, or about $330 million a year. That is a 10 percent reduction from a previous draft in April.
俄罗斯《新闻报》报道，俄罗斯2016-25年的预算草案包括大约三十三亿美元用于空间站，平均一年大约三亿三千万美元，比去年4月草案中拨款少了百分之十。
Russia's space agency is one of five that works together to operate the station with a rotating crew of astronauts that conduct experiments. Russia plays a key role in transporting the crew to and from the station, since the United States retired its fleet of vehicles to send astronauts into space.
俄罗斯宇航局是运营国际空间站的五个机构之一。国际空间站有来自不同国家的宇航员轮流到那里进行科学试验。美国接送宇航员所用的航天飞机退役后，俄罗斯发挥了在地球与空间站之间接送宇航员的重要作用。
The United States has funded the largest portion of the station's budget since it launched in 1998 and currently spends about $3 billion a year on the project.
国际空间站1998年发射升空以来，美国对空间站预算的贡献最大，每年拨款约30亿美元。
