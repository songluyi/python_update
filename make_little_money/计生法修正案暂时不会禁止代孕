A proposed legal ban on the use of surrogate mothers has been scrapped after lawmakers raised objections over the effectiveness of such a move, it was announced on Sunday.
Other amendments in the approved draft include allowing couples to have two children and extending maternity leave for mothers who abide by the law. The revised law comes into effect on Friday.
