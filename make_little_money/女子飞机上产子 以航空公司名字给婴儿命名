A pregnant woman who unexpectedly went into labour and gave birth to a baby boy onboard a Jetstar Asia flight has named her son after the airline.
According to a Jetstar spokesman, the boy's birth was met with a round of applause from the plane's passengers, who were mostly Myanmar nationals. The baby boy, who weighed six pounds and seven ounces (2.9kg), is the first to be delivered on a Jetstar Asia flight.
