It was a bloody day in Tel Aviv Tuesday when a Palestinian stabbed an American tourist to death and wounded 12 Israelis while U.S. Vice President Joe Biden held talks just a few kilometers away.
特拉维夫星期二发生流血事件，一名巴勒斯坦人刺死一名美国游客，刺伤12名以色列人，而美国副总统拜登在仅几公里之外与以色列领导人举行会谈。
Witnesses say the Palestinian ran down the boardwalk in the port of Jaffa, a popular tourist site, and started stabbing people before police shot him dead.
目击者说，这名巴勒斯坦人从雅法港的木栈道跑下来，开始刺杀行人，直到警察将他击毙。那里是一个热门的旅游点。
Just a short distance away, Biden was meeting with former Israeli president Shimon Peres, who condemned Tuesday's violence and said successful peace talks are the only answer.
而在不远处，拜登副总统与以色列前总统佩雷斯正举行会晤。佩雷斯谴责了星期二发生的暴力，并表示成功的和谈是唯一答案。
"Terror leads to nowhere, neither to Arabs nor to us," Peres said. "The majority of the people know there is no alternative to the two-state solution...and we shall follow with our strength and dedication to make from it a new reality."
他说，“恐怖将没有出路，无论是对阿拉伯人还是我们。”佩雷斯说，“大多数人都知道除了两国解决办法之外没有别的选择......我们应该以实力和奉献精神创造一个新的现实。”
U.S. President Barack Obama has said there will be no comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement before he leaves office next January. The White House also has said Biden is not bringing any new peace initiatives during his talks in Israel.
美国总统奥巴马已经表示，在他明年一月卸任之前不会有全面的以巴和平协议。白宫也表示，拜登在以色列会晤期间将不会提出任何新的和平倡议。
