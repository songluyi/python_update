The US Department of Commerce (DOC) is expected to announce a lift on the export curbs imposed on ZTE later this week, two weeks after the ban was put into place, media reports said on Monday.
On March 7, the DOC announced export restrictions against ZTE. Manufacturers outside the US would also be prohibited from selling products with a significant amount of US components to ZTE, according to the DOC. Under the ban, US suppliers will need to apply for an export license before shipping anything to ZTE, but the license applications generally would be denied, said the DOC.
