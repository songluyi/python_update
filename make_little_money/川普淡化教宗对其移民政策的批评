川普星期四在南卡罗莱纳州召开的市民会议上表示，教宗方济各的评论有可能被媒体过分夸大了。
"I don't like fighting with the pope, actually. I don't think this is a fight. I think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media. I think that he heard one side of the story, which is probably by the Mexican government. He didn't see the tremendous strain that you know the border is causing us with respect to illegal immigration, with the drugs pouring across the border...."

川普的一些反对者支持教宗。
