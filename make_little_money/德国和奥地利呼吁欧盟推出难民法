Germany and Austria are working on a proposal for a common European asylum law, Germany's refugee crisis coordinator said in an interview with German magazine Focus.
Peter Altmaier, who Chancellor Angela Merkel tasked with overseeing the government's handling of the refugee crisis, said in an interview published on Saturday that he was working closely with Josef Ostermayer, an Austrian minister involved in policy on the migration crisis. "We're talking about what such a system could look like," said Altmaier, who is also Merkel's chief of staff.
