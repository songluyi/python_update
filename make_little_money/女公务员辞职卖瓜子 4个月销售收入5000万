Duan Xiangqing, born in 1986, spent several years as a civil servant in the Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau in a city in eastern China's Shandong province.
On the topic of her resignation, Duan says, "I firmly believed in the great potential of e-commerce and I wanted to run my own business. My WeChat online shop made a good profit by selling fried melon seeds, which gave me a great deal of confidence. So I decided to resign and focus all my energy on my shop."
