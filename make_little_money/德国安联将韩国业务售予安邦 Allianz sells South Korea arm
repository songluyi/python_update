 Allianz has pulled out of South Korea, selling its poorly performing business there to Anbang, the acquisitive Chinese group which last week failed in its quest to buy Starwood Hotels.
 德国安联保险集团(Allianz)已撤出韩国，将其在韩国业绩不佳的业务售予收购意愿强烈的中国企业安邦(Anbang)，上周，安邦竞购喜达屋酒店(Starwood Hotels)失败。
 The disposal is a setback to the German insurer’s ambitions in Asia, where it sees growing scale as a way to hit its ambitious target of 5 per cent annual earnings growth. Last year, it teamed up with Baidu to offer digital insurance in China, and also expanded in the Philippines.
 此番出售意味着这家德国保险公司在亚洲的抱负受挫，在亚洲，该公司将扩大规模视为实现其每年盈利增长5%的雄心勃勃目标的一种途径。去年，安联与百度(Baidu)联手在中国推出数字保险业务，还在菲律宾扩大了业务。
 The group has been in South Korea for 17 years, owning life insurance and asset management businesses. Just after it bought into the country, it said it was “well on the way to combining Korean and western insurance expertise into an effective, profitable business approach”.
 安联在韩国经营业务已有17年时间，拥有寿险和资产管理业务。就在通过收购进入韩国后，安联曾表示，“准备将韩国和西方的保险专长结合起来变成一种有效且盈利的商业模式”。
