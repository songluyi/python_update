 大众汽车(Volkswagen)可能面临金额达上百亿美元的新罚款，原因是美国最高消费者权益保护机构针对这家汽车制造商的尾气造假丑闻提起了诉讼。

 美国联邦贸易委员会（Federal Trade Commission，简称FTC）周二提交的一份寻求让大众汽车偿还“不当得利”的诉状显示，该机构正在为消费者们争取最高或超过150亿美元的赔偿。

 FTC指控称，大众汽车在七年的时间里以推介“清洁柴油”汽车的广告活动系统性地欺骗了消费者，这种汽车造成的污染其实大大高于美国政府规定中许可的水平。
 VW has admitted to equipping up to 11m diesel-powered cars around the world with software that tricked regulators by reducing nitrogen oxide emissions only when pollution tests were under way.
 大众汽车已承认，其在世界各地多达1100万辆柴油车上安装了一种软件，这种软件只在车辆接受尾气污染物检测时降低车辆的氮氧化物排放、从而骗过监管机构。
