Chinese actress Yang Ying, better known by her stage name Angelababy, has become the youngest ambassador for WildAid, an environmental organization that focuses on reducing the demand for wildlife products.
Angelababy also admits that prior to her involvement in this campaign, she did not know too much about pangolins, also known as scaly ant-eaters. Four species of the mammal live in Asia, with two in Africa.
