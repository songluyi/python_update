Suzuki Motor says it has been using improper methods to test the fuel economy of its vehicles, sending its stock down 9.4 per cent as the disclosure triggered concerns more companies could be affected by the scandal that began with Mitsubishi Motors.
日本第四大汽车制造商铃木汽车(Suzuki Motor)表示，它使用了不恰当的方法来检测其汽车的燃油效率。这一披露导致该公司股价下挫9.4%，外界担心，可能会有更多的公司被始于三菱汽车(Mitsubishi Motors)的丑闻波及。
Suzuki, Japan’s fourth-largest carmaker, said its testing methods had not complied with domestic standards since 2010, after checking all 16 of the models sold in its home market involving 2.1m vehicles.
铃木表示，自2010年以来，其检测方法一直未遵守国内标准。此前，该公司对在本土市场销售的全部16种车型进行了检测，涉及210万辆汽车。
But the producer of small cars said it did not see a need to revise its fuel economy figures since the performance of its vehicles did not differ significantly using a proper testing method. It also did not find any manipulation of fuel efficiency data.
不过，这家生产小型汽车的制造商表示，它不认为有必要修改其燃油效率数字，原因是使用恰当的检测方法后，并未发现其车辆的燃油效率表现有显著不同。另外，铃木也未发现自己有任何操纵燃油效率数据的行为。
The Japanese transport ministry has ordered carmakers to review their fuel economy data and testing methods after Mitsubishi disclosed last month that some of its employees overstated fuel efficiency by up to 10 per cent on four types of petrol-powered small cars sold in Japan, including two models built for Nissan and sold under its brand.
上月，三菱披露，其部分员工对在日本销售的四款汽油动力小型汽车的燃油效率高估了至多10%，其中包括两款为日产(Nissan)代工并以日产品牌销售的汽车。随后，日本国土交通省命令汽车制造商审查各自的燃油效率数据和检测方法。
In a statement on Wednesday, Suzuki, which has a strong presence in India where its Maruti Suzuki affiliate controls nearly half the market, said no overseas models were affected. It added that it did not find any problem with the emissions performance of its vehicles.
在周三发布的一份声明中，铃木表示，其销往海外市场的车型未受影响。该公司补充称，未发现其车辆的排放表现存在任何问题。
