China's top three telecom operators unveiled their plans last Tuesday to improve 4G services as part of the country's efforts to update its information infrastructure.
Meanwhile, China Telecom, China's largest fixed-line service provider, is working to raise Internet connection speeds to at least 35 megabytes per second on average. One-third of China Telecom users will have access to rates between 50 and 100 megabytes.
