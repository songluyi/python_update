A pregnant woman in northern China died this week after she fell unconscious on a busy city street and got her head stuck in a fence, Chinese media reported on Wednesday.
"She seemed to feel dizzy, and intended to lean against the railing to take a rest, but then fainted and her head slipped into the rails," the state broadcaster CCTV quoted an unnamed bystander as saying.
