U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday the international effort to defeat the Islamic State group is "moving in the right direction," but he cautioned more must be done to support stabilization in Libya and Iraq.
美国国务卿克里星期二表示，打击伊斯兰国组织的国际努力“正在朝正确的方向发展”，不过他谨慎表示，维持利比亚和伊拉克的稳定，仍需做出更多的努力。
Kerry spoke at the opening of a ministerial meeting in Rome where representatives from about 20 countries came to talk about ways to boost the anti-Islamic State campaign.
克里在罗马部长级会议上发表了上述讲话。约20个国家派代表参加这次会议，商讨强化打击伊斯兰国组织的途径。
He highlighted the risk of the militants taking control in Libya with its vast oil resources, but said that a near agreement on a new national unity government would go a long way to preventing that scenario.
克里强调了极端分子控制利比亚庞大石油资源的风险，不过克里说，接近达成的一项有关新国民团结政府的协议对预防这种情况的发生意义深远。
Kerry also called attention to the humanitarian situation in Syria, saying it is a "catastrophe" not seen since World War 2. He said nations need to "speak out powerfully" about the need for a cease-fire, the end of sieges and urgent deliveries of aid to every area where people are in need.
克里还呼吁关注叙利亚的人道主义状况，称之为二战以来从未见过的“灾难”。克里说，各国需要就停火、结束围困以及向困境中的民众提供紧急援助，发出强有力的声音。
