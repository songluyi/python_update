At least 110 people were killed and more than 350 others injured in a massive fire that broke out during a fireworks display at a temple in the southern Indian state of Kerala early last Sunday morning, a senior police official said.
Indian military choppers have been pressed into service to ferry the injured to the hospitals and the state government has cancelled the leaves of all doctors and demanding them to report to duty.
