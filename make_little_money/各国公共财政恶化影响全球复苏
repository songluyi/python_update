 Public finances across the world are deteriorating, threatening to undermine the global recovery, the International Monetary Fund warned on Wednesday.
 国际货币基金组织(IMF)周三警告称，世界各国的公共财政都在恶化，这有可能破坏全球复苏。
 Urging nations to find a “comprehensive policy package” to improve growth and public finances, the fund said action was urgently needed to reduce vulnerabilities in the global economy it has been highlighting in Washington this week.
 IMF敦促各国出台“全面的政策方案”来提高经济增长并改善公共财政，它表示，各国亟需采取行动来降低全球经济的脆弱性。IMF本周在华盛顿列举了全球经济的种种脆弱性。
 High debt, low inflation and low growth have added to fiscal pressures in advanced economies, increasing the burden of public debt compared with previous forecasts. As a result, the ratio of debt to national income — currently 107.6 per cent of national income — is now only expected to begin to decline in 2017.
 与此前的预测相比，高负债、低通胀和低增长加大了发达经济体的财政压力，增加了公共债务负担。其结果是，债务与国民收入之比（目前达到107.6%）预计要到2017年才会开始下降。
 The IMF warned of “tough policy adjustments ahead” in emerging economies particularly in commodity exporters, but praised China’s fiscal package aimed at stabilising its economy. But it said Beijing should “ increase on-budget support for household consumption while scaling down off-budget public investment” to help the transition away from investment as the locomotive of growth.
 IMF警告称，新兴经济体（尤其是大宗商品出口国）面临“艰巨的政策调整”，但它赞扬了中国为稳定经济而出台的财政政策。不过IMF表示，北京方面应该“在预算中增加对家庭消费的支持，同时削减预算外的公共投资”以帮助中国逐渐摆脱以投资促增长的经济增长模式。
