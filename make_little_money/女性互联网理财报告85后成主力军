With wealth management services getting extensive attention of Chinese families in recent years, demand for such services is rising among women, said Beijing Morning Post Tuesday.
Even though younger female investors dominate the Internet financing world with their sheer numbers, women who were born in the 1960s rule the list with hard cash. Female investors who were born in the 1960s number just 16 percent, but invest on average 129,000 yuan, which is nine times more than the post-90s group and three times more than the post-85 group. The amount is also 25,000 yuan higher than the average invested by men of the same age group.
