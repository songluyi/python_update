Taiwan's China-friendly Nationalist Party has elected its first female leader after ousting her as its presidential candidate ahead of January elections that were won by pro-independence rivals.
Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated Hung from Beijing, saying he hoped the two parties would continue to oppose "Taiwan independence," according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
