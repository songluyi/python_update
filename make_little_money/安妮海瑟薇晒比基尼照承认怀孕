It was reported that Anne Hathaway was expecting her first child back in November, but now, the actress has officially confirmed the news in the best way possible.
早在去年11月时，安妮·海瑟薇就被曝怀有身孕，但直到现在，这位美国女演员才首度松口，用最好的方式正式公布了这一消息。
Early Monday morning, the "Les Misérables" star shared a picture on Instagram, in which she's seen posing in a red bikini while holding her growing belly. She's absolutely beaming in the pic, flashing a huge smile for the camera.
周一清晨，这位曾出演《悲惨世界》的女星在Instagram上分享了一张照片。照片上的她身着红色比基尼，用手托住愈发明显的孕肚，面朝镜头，笑容灿烂。
What makes the photo even better is the fact that Hathaway beat the paparazzi at their own game by sharing it first.
海瑟薇抢在狗仔之前发布了孕照，这让照片显得更胜一筹。
"So, posting a bikini pic is a little out of character for me, but just now while I was at the beach I noticed I was being photographed," the 33-year-old wrote in the caption. "I figure if this kind of photo is going to be out in the world it should at least be an image that makes me happy (and be one that was taken with my consent. And with a filter :)."
“发布比基尼照不太像我的风格，但刚刚，就在海滩上，我发现有人在偷拍我，” 33岁的海瑟薇在配文中写道，“我想如果这种照片一定要流传出去，那它起码得符合我的心意（流传出去的照片应该征得我的同意。最好再加上滤镜）。”
As noted, the baby will be the first for Hathaway and her husband, Adam Shulman. The two married in 2012 after dating for four years.
如前所述，这是海瑟薇和她的丈夫亚当·舒尔曼的第一个孩子。他们于2012年结束了四年的恋爱长跑，正式迈入婚姻殿堂。
Wishing her all the best!
祝海瑟薇一切顺利！
