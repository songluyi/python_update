North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered tests of a nuclear warhead in the "nearest future," state-run news agency KCNA said Tuesday.
South Korean President, Park Geun-Hye, warned North Korea should be ready to accept the consequences if it did not curb its nuclear ambitions. "North Korea will walk the path of self-destruction if it does not change," Park said at a cabinet meeting.
