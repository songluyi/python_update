The rise of the new entrepreneurs on Chinese mainland has posed challenge to the traditional concept of "entrepreneurs", says a report released by HSBC Private Bank on Dec. 8, 2015.
The most important finding in this survey is the difference in influence of the family and connection on entrepreneurs between the West and East. 54 percent of Asian entrepreneurs surveyed are from families with enterprises, 10 percent higher than the number in the West. On Chinese mainland, the percentage of this group is even higher â€” 62 percent of the surveyed entrepreneurs are from families that already own companies.
