China, the world's top gold producer and consumer, launched a yuan-denominated gold benchmark on Tuesday.
"The Shanghai gold benchmark will provide a fair and tradable yuan-denominated gold fix price for global investors. It will help improve yuan pricing mechanism and promote internationalization of the Chinese gold market," Pan Gongsheng, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, said.
