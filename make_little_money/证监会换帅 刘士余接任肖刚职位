Liu Shiyu was appointed as Party leader and chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), according to decisions made by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council on Saturday. Xiao Gang, former head of the CSRC, was removed from his post as the chairman as well as the Party leader of the commission.
Xiao, 57, took over as chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission in March 2013. He was in charge of overseeing the market in mid-2015 when the benchmark Shanghai index plummeted by almost a third, wiping off trillions of dollars and jolting global markets.
