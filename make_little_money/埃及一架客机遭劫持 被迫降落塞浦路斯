An Egyptian passenger plane, EgyptAir MS181, has made an emergency landing on Cyprus after being hijacked by a man wearing a suicide vest.
Former European Commissioner for Education, Androulla Vassiliou, tweeted that hijackers have demanded that authorities leave runway 'in order to release women and children passengers'.
