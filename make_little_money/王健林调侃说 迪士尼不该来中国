Wang Jianlin has taken a shot at Disney as the Chinese billionaire’s Dalian Wanda Group prepares to open a theme park in a direct challenge to Walt Disney's forthcoming Shanghai resort.
王健林日前向迪士尼喊话。这位大连万达(Wanda)集团的中国亿万富翁计划开设一个主题公园，直接挑战迪士尼公司(Walt Disney)即将投入运营的上海度假胜地。
"Disney really shouldn't have entered the mainland,” Mr Wang said on China Central Television on Sunday. “We will make Disney's China venture unprofitable in the next 10 to 20 years," he said, as he unveiled ambitions to surpass Disney as the world's largest tourism enterprise by 2020.
“迪士尼实在不该来大陆，”王建林周日在中国央视上表示：“我们（万达）会让迪士尼中国在未来10到20年都无法盈利。” 他透露了到2020年超越迪士尼成为世界最大旅游企业的雄心。
Disney's Shanghai office said on Tuesday that Mr Wang’s comments “were not worthy of a response”.
迪士尼上海办事处周二表示，王健林的言论“不值得回应”。
The group also aims to open "two or three" Wanda City leisure resorts outside of China by the end of this year, investing "between Rmb20 ($3.1bn) and Rmb30bn ($4.6bn) in each", it said on Tuesday. It is also looking for a Wanda City site near London, but gave no timeline. “The project has significance for us — London attracts tourists from around the world," it said.
万达集团周二表示，还计划在今年底之前在中国境外开张“两、三个”万达旅游城休闲度假地，每处投资“介于200亿元人民币（合31亿美元）到300亿元人民币（合46亿美元）之间”。该集团还在伦敦附近觅址建设万达旅游城，但没有给出时间表。“这个项目对我们来说意义重大——伦敦吸引着全球的游客，”该集团表示
