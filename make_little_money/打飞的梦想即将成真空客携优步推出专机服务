European aerospace giant Airbus Group SE will cooperate with US ride-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc to provide on-demand flights with its H125 and H130 helicopters, Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders said.
The cooperation with Uber comes as Airbus's Enders seeks to push innovation at the Toulouse, France-based company that makes everything from civil airplanes to military transporters. Airbus has armed its Silicon Valley branch with US$150 million in venture capital to invest in promising aerospace startups around the world.
