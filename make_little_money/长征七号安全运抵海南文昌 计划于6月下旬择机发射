China's fourth space launch center, the Wenchang satellite launch center in southern Hainan Province, is preparing for its maiden launch mission.
The Long March-7, a medium-sized rocket using liquid propellant, can carry up to 13.5 tons to low Earth orbit. It will transport cargo for China's planned space station and is expected to become a main carrier for space launches.
