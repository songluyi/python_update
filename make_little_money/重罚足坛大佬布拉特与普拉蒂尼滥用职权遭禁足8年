FIFA President Sepp Blatter and European soccer boss Michel Platini were both banned from soccer for eight years yesterday for ethics violations, leaving the global game leaderless as it fights a swirl of corruption cases.
The decision means that Blatter's 17 years at the helm of world soccer will end in disgrace, and spells the end of Platini's hopes of replacing the 79-year-old Swiss in a presidential election in February.
