The world has taken "concrete" steps to prevent nuclear terrorism, President Obama told the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington. But the so-called Islamic State (IS) obtaining a nuclear weapon is "one of the greatest threats to global security," he added.
Mr Obama cited progress in making large parts of the world free of nuclear materials. South America had already achieved this, and Central Europe and South East Asia were expected to do so later this year.
