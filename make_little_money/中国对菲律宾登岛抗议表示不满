China has expressed anger after Filipino protesters landed on a remote island controlled by the Philippines in the disputed South China Sea. The island of Pagasa in the South China Sea is controlled by the Philippines.
China claims almost all the South China Sea, believed to be rich in resources, dismissing rival claims by neighbours. Apart from the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam all lay claim to the disputed waters.
