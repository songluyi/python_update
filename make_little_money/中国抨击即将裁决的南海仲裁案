中国对即将出炉的南中国海仲裁结果发出严厉谴责，一名高级官员称菲律宾提起的这一诉讼是一起旨在欺骗的恶劣行为。
Xu Hong, director of treaties and law atthe foreign ministry, reiterated Beijing’s position that a UNarbitration tribunal in The Hague had no jurisdiction when it came to a lawsuitover the status of 15 islands, reefs and shoals claimed by China.
中国外交部条约法律司司长徐宏重申了北京方面的立场，即海牙联合国仲裁庭对南海仲裁案没有管辖权，该案件涉及中国声索的15个岛屿、珊瑚礁和浅滩的法律归属。
The tribunal, launched in 2013, will rulebased on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which counts both Beijing andManila as signatories.
南海案仲裁庭于2013年成立，将依据《联合国海洋法公约》(UN Convention on the Law of the Sea)作出判决，中国和菲律宾都是该公约的缔约国。
Mr Xu said the process was a “typical actof abuse of dispute resolution mechanisms”and Beijing had nointention to abide by the court’s decision, which he expected soon. China has not appeared at thetribunal.
徐宏表示这一过程属于“典型的滥用公约”，预计仲裁庭将于近期作出裁决，中国政府并不打算遵守裁决。中国没有出席仲裁审理。
At issue is its claim to a historic zone ofinfluence marked by the so-called nine-dash-line, which covers 90 per cent ofthe South China Sea. The territorial rights date back 2,000 years, according toBeijing, which claims dozens of tiny islands, shoals, reefs and underwaterrocks throughout the sea.
争论焦点是中国依据所谓的九段线所主张的历史性权利范围，它涵盖了南中国海90%的海域。北京方面表示中国在南中国海的领土权利可追溯至2000年前，其声索对象包括整个南中国海上几十个小岛、沙洲、暗礁和海底岩石。
Experts say the court will almost certainlyreject those claims, and, with them, much of the rationale for China’s interpretationof the nine-dash line.
专家表示海牙仲裁庭几乎肯定会拒绝这些主张，以及中国对九段线说明的大多数阐释。
