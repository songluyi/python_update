An Iranian military official says 10 U.S. Navy sailors detained by Iran are expected to be released Wednesday, a day after they drifted into Iranian territorial waters.
一名伊朗军方官员说，预计被伊朗拘留的10名美国海军军人将于周三获释。一天前，这些美国军人乘坐的小艇进入伊朗领海。
State television quoted Gen. Ali Fadavi, the Navy chief of the Revolutionary Guard, saying a mechanical problem in the sailors' navigation system caused them to enter Iranian waters.
伊朗国家电视台援引伊朗革命卫队海军首脑法达维将军的话说，这些美国海军的导航系统发生机械故障，致使他们进入伊朗领海。
Fadavi said earlier that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in a phone call the U.S. should apologize for the incident.
法达维早些时候表示，伊朗外长扎里夫通过电话对美国国务卿克里说，美国应就这一事件道歉。
The nine men and one woman were on two small vessels traveling in the Persian Gulf between Kuwait and Bahrain on Tuesday when U.S. controllers lost contact with them.
载有10名美国海军军人的两艘小艇在波斯湾行驶于科威特和巴林之间时，美国控制人员与他们失去联系。这10名海军军人9人是男性，另外一人是女性。
"There may have been mechanical failure on one of the vessels, but it is unclear at this time," a defense official told VOA. "My assumption is that they were in Iranian territorial waters when they were detained."
一名美国国防部官员星期二对美国之音表示，“其中一艘船上可能出现机械故障，但目前还不清楚。我猜测是他们是在伊朗海域被扣留的。”
