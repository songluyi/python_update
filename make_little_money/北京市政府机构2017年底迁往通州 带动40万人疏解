The municipal government of Beijing will move to the suburban district of Tongzhou at the end of 2017, a high-ranking official said on Monday.
Along with the municipal government, the Beijing Committee of the Communist Party of China, the People's Congress of Beijing, and the Beijing Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will also move to the new location, Li said. These are the four components of China's political structure.
