A young Yazidi woman pleaded on Wednesday (December 16) for the United Nations Security Council to wipe out Islamic State after describing the torture and rape she suffered at the hands of the militants, who abducted her as "war booty" and held her for three months.
Last August, the young girl's life changed for the worse when she was abducted in August last year from her village in Iraq and taken by bus to a building in the Islamic State stronghold of Mosul, where thousands of Yazidi women and children were exchanged by militants as gifts.
