The International Astronomic Union on Monday approved China's naming of four geographic entities on the moon. "Guanghan Gong," "Zi Wei," "Tian Shi" and "Tai Wei" will be used in official celestial maps to refer to part of the moon where China's Chang'e 3 lunar probe landed.
In Chinese mythology, Chang'e is the goddess of the moon while "Guang Han Gong" is the palace that houses Chang'e and her pet Yutu (Jade Rabbit).
