Former U.S. Senator Bob Graham says Americans are "fully capable" of making up their own minds about 28 classified pages that discuss possible foreign support for those who carried out the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.
前美国联邦参议员格雷厄姆说，美国人民“完全有能力”对28页有关外国支持2001年9月11日恐怖袭击的机密材料做出判断。
The pages are from a joint congressional committee report that came out 14 years ago, but then-President George W. Bush ordered that chapter not be included in the public release of 800 other pages. Some officials with access to the chapter have made comments alluding to Saudi Arabia, but without being able to offer details the exact connections suggested remain a mystery to most of the country.
这些材料出自一个国会联合委员会14年前撰写的报告，但当时的总统乔治·W.布什下令，不准把这一章节与其他800页材料一道公诸于众。一些看过这一章节的官员曾经发表评论，暗示沙特阿拉伯与9/11恐怖袭击有关，但未能提供确凿细节。
Graham has been a strong advocate in the push to have the pages released to the public. He said a White House official told him President Barack Obama would make a decision by June and that he viewed that as a "step in the right direction."
格雷厄姆一直坚决主张公布这些材料。他说，一位白宫官员向他透露，奥巴马总统将于6月做出决定，他认为这是“朝着正确的方向迈进了一步”。
The 9/11 Commission and the congressional committee have definitively determined Saudi Arabia had no intent to support al-Qaida.
9/11委员会和国会委员会坚信，沙特阿拉伯没有支持基地组织的意愿。
