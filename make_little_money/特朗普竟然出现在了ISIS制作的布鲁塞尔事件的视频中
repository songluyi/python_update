A pro-Islamic State media group has released a video that celebrates the Brussels terror attacks and features Donald Trump's voice and picture.
The video, titled "The Exile of Islam and Brussels Attacks," features scenes from both the attack on Zaventem airport and the Maelbeek metro station. It also shows imagery of Belgian ISIS fighter Abul Qa'Qa al-Baljiki, who participated in the Jan. 7, 2015, attack on the Paris offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 11 people, according to MEMRI, a group that tracks jihadist propaganda and provided the video to Yahoo News on Thursday.
