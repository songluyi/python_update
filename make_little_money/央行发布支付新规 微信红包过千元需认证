The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said on Monday that it would tighten the regulations on non-banking online payment platforms, to curb risks like financial fraud and money laundering.
"The basic function of these platforms is to facilitate the development of e-commerce", said Xie Zhong, director of the PBOC payment and settlement department.
