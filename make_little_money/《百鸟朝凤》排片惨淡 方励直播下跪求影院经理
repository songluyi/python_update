A producer and promoter for Wu Tianming's posthumous film "Song of the Phoenix" has kneeled down in an online video, begging theater owners for more showtime for the film.
Wu Tianming, a leading man in the Chinese film industry's fourth generation of filmmakers, had finished his last film entitled "Song of the Phoenix" before his death but never had a chance to see it released. He died on March 4, 2014 from a heart attack at the age of 74, just one month after he finished the editing for "Song of the Phoenix," which tells the story of the friendship between two suona horn (a Chinese woodwind musical instrument) artists from two separate generations.
