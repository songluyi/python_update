Turkish forces have killed 3,000 Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says, insisting no other country has matched its efforts against the extremists.
土耳其总统埃尔多安表示，土耳其军队在叙利亚和伊拉克打死了3000名伊斯兰国组织的激进分子。他坚称没有任何国家能够与土耳其打击极端分子的努力相提并论。
In an address Wednesday to Balkan nations' military chiefs, Erdogan denounced those who accused Turkey of supporting the Islamic State group. "There have been those who have ... been vile by showing Turkey as a country that helps Daesh," he said, using another name for the extremist group.
埃尔多安星期三在对巴尔干国家军事指挥官的一次演讲中对那些指责土耳其支持伊斯兰国组织的人提出谴责。他说：“有些人一直卑鄙地把土耳其说成是帮助伊斯兰国组织的国家。”
NATO member Turkey reluctantly joined the U.S.-led, anti-IS coalition and has faced criticism that it's not doing enough to protect its borders from fighters moving into Europe. But Turkey says it needs more help from Western allies, particularly near the Syrian border where Turkish territory has been targeted by rocket fire.
作为北约成员，土耳其很不情愿地加入了美国领导的打击伊斯兰国的同盟，它被指责没有采取足够行动阻止伊斯兰国组织的武装人员透过其边界进入欧洲。但是，土耳其说，它需要西方同盟国提供更多支持，特别是在叙利亚边界附近，那里一直是火箭弹袭击的目标。
