Shanghai is now on par with Tokyo, moving up two places to become the 11th most expensive city in the world to live in, and the most expensive on the Chinese mainland, according to a 2015 worldwide cost of living report released by the Economist Intelligence Unit on Thursday.
A white-collar worker who worked in Beijing and is now living in Shanghai told the Beijing News that the cost to rent a home in Shanghai is on a par with Beijing. Transportation costs are slightly higher in Shanghai and spending on dining out or high-end goods and services are much higher than in Beijing.
