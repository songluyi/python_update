 A landmark same sex marriage case was dismissed today by a judge in central China, but gay activists praised the suit for raising awareness of the issue in a country where homosexuals still face considerable social disapproval.
 中国华中地区一家法院周三驳回了一起具有里程碑意义的同性婚姻案，但同性恋活动人士称赞这起诉讼在中国提高了人们对这个问题的意识，同性恋在中国仍面临很大程度的社会不认同。
 The case, believed to be China’s first test of the right of homosexuals to marry, was thrown out after only a short hearing when the court found that Chinese law requires that only a man and a woman may marry, writes the FT’s Patti Waldmeir.
 本案被认为是中国有关同性婚姻权利的首次尝试。法庭在经过时间不长的庭审后驳回原告请求，认为中国法律规定一男一女才能结婚。
 The plantiffs had claimed that the law allowed “a husband and a wife” to marry but did not specify their gender. Gay activists were not expecting the case to have much chance of succeeding.
 此前两名原告的主张是中国《婚姻法》的原文是中国实行“一夫一妻”的婚姻制度，而并未具体规定性别。同性恋活动人士本来就不预期本案会有多少胜算。
 Sun Wenlin, a 27-year-old employee of an internet firm, asked the court to overrule a local authority which denied him the right to marry his partner, a 37-year-old security guard he met online. In China, many gays enter into opposite sex marriages to satisfy family and to have children. But same sex marriage is illegal.
 27岁的互联网公司雇员孙文林请求法院推翻当地民政局拒绝为他和他在网上结识的伴侣、一名37岁的保安办理结婚登记手续的决定。在中国，很多同性恋者为满足家人意愿而选择异性婚姻和生育子女。同性婚姻是不合法的。
