A lecturer at Xidian University in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, has called on students in her female-only class to sign a pledge that they will not have sex before marriage.
The lecturer didn't force anyone to sign. However, many students still disliked being faced with such a promise. Li Yuan, a college student at another university in Xi'an, said the lecturer's behavior violated privacy, and she would never sign anything like that.
