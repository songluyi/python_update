Hong Kong film-maker Stephen Chow won the battle at the Chinese New Year box office , with his movie Mermaid topping two others which boasted the heavyweight star power of Chow Yun Fat and Aaron Kwok.
The fantasy comedy set a new single-day record for China's homemade movies, collecting 276 million yuan ($59 million) in ticket receipts, said website NetEase. The previous record-holder was comedy Lost In Hong Kong, with a haul of 247 million yuan last year.
