Google's artificial intelligence (AI) program AlphaGo on Tuesday triumphed in its final game against South Korean Go grandmaster Lee Sedol to win the five-game series 4-1.
At a press conference held after the final match, Mr Lee said he did not necessarily think AlphaGo was superior to humans. But he said he had more studying to do, and admitted the matches had challenged some of his ideas about the game Go.
