A U.S. B-52 bomber, capable of delivering nuclear missile, was deployed on Sunday in South Korea in retaliation for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s fourth nuclear test.
It can also deliver air-to-ground nuclear missiles with a range of 200 km and air-launched cruise missiles with a range of 2,500-3,000 km.
