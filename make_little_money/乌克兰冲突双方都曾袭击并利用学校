Human Rights Watch said Thursday that both sides in the conflict in Ukraine have indiscriminately attacked schools, which could amount to a war crime.
人权观察星期四说，乌克兰冲突双方都不加区别地袭击学校，这样做可以等同于战争罪。
In a report entitled “Studying Under Fire,” the rights group documented how both the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed rebels have carried out attacks on schools and used them for military purposes, including basing troops or weapons in or near schools.
人权观察发表题为《在战火下学习》的报告，记录了乌克兰军队和由俄罗斯支持的乌克兰反政府武装袭击学校，把学校用于军事目的，包括在校园或附近地区驻扎军队或存放武器。
Yulia Gorbunova, the HRW researcher who authored the report, said this happened on a wide scale in eastern Ukraine.
撰写这份报告的人权观察研究员戈尔布诺娃说，这种行为在乌克兰东部广泛存在。
According to data in the report provided by the Ukrainian Ministry of Education, 119 schools and kindergartens in its areas were damaged in fighting between April 2014 and November 2015. De facto rebel authorities reported damage to nearly 900 schools in their areas during the same period.
乌克兰教育部提供的一份报告里的数据显示，从2014年4月到2015年11月，乌克兰政府控制地区有119所学校和幼儿园受到战火破坏。反政府武装报告说，在其控制区内，同一时期有将近900所学校遭到破坏。
HRW’s Gorbunova said both the government and rebels are open to discussions about the right’s group’s findings.
戈尔布诺娃说，乌克兰政府和反政府武装都愿意就人权观察的调查结果进行讨论。
HRW urged both sides to take concrete actions to deter the military use of schools.
人权观察敦促乌克兰双方采取具体行动，不再把学校用做军事目的。
