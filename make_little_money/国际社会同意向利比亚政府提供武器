The US and other world powers agreed on Monday to support sending arms to the internationally recognised Libyan government to help it fight Isis , in a rare show of unity from the global community.
美国及其他世界大国周一同意支持向国际承认的利比亚政府发放武器，以帮助其对抗“伊拉克和黎凡特伊斯兰国”(ISIS)。此举罕见地展示了全球社会的团结。
John Kerry, US secretary of state, said that the governments would seek an exemption to a UN arms ban that would allow them to supply weapons to the national unity government in Tripoli.
美国国务卿约翰•克里(John Kerry)称，各国政府将寻求联合国武器禁令的豁免，允许他们向的黎波里的民族团结政府提供武器。
The decision represents an important step in the growing legitimacy of the Government of National Accord, which is backed by the UN. Libya has been split between two governments since 2014, with rival parliaments located in Tripoli and the east. The GNA has been fighting to impose its control over the two competing governments, as well as various militias and jihadi groups, including Isis.
该决定代表着联合国所支持的利比亚民族团结政府(Government of National Accord)合法性日益提升的重要一步。利比亚自2014年以来分裂为两个政府，对立的议会分别位于的黎波里和东部。民族团结政府一直在作战，力求控制两个对立的政府、以及各路民兵组织和包括ISIS在内的圣战组织。
Speaking in Vienna after a meeting with the other major powers, Mr Kerry said that the GNA was “the only entity that can unify the country” and was “the only way to generate the cohesion necessary to defeat Daesh”, another name for Isis.
在与其他大国举行会议后，克里在维也纳发表讲话称，民族团结政府是“可以统一国家的唯一实体”，也是“产生击败‘达伊沙’(Daesh)所需的凝聚力的唯一方式”。达伊沙是ISIS的另一个名字。
The meeting in Vienna brought together all the permanent members of the UN Security Council, including Russia and China, and a number of other governments in the region. In a statement, the governments said that they supported maintaining the UN arms embargo, but would support the GNA’s request for “necessary lethal arms” to counter Isis and other terrorist groups.
维也纳召开的会议将联合国安理会(UN Security Council)的常任理事国（包括俄罗斯和中国）、以及该地区的其他一些政府召集在一起。在声明中，各国政府称，他们支持维护联合国武器禁运，但是会支持利比亚民族团结政府对于“必要的致命武器”的请求，以抗击ISIS和其他恐怖主义组织。
