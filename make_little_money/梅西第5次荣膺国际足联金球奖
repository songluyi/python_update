Now score it Lionel Messi 5, Cristiano Ronaldo 3.
Messi won the Ballon d'Or trophy in Zurich on Monday as the world's best player in 2015, ending Cristiano Ronaldo's two-year hold on soccer's top individual honor.
瑞士苏黎世当地时间11日，梅西荣膺2015世界最佳球员奖项——金球奖，结束了C罗此前两年对这一足坛个人最高荣誉的垄断。
"It's incredible that it's my fifth," said the 28-year-old Barcelona and Argentina forward, who won four straight FIFA awards from 2009-12.
现年28岁的梅西曾于2009至2012年度连续四年获得国际足联金球奖。这位巴萨球员、阿根廷前锋称：“难以置信这是我的第五座奖杯。”
Messi earned his record-extending fifth after being runner-up to his great rival for the past two years.
在此次创纪录的五获奖杯前，梅西连续两年屈居“劲敌”C罗之后，位列第二。
"It's a very special moment for me to be back here on the stage," Messi said in Spanish in his acceptance speech, "after being there in the audience watching Cristiano win."
发表获奖感言时，梅西用西班牙语说道：“再次站在这个地方，这个时刻对我来说很特别。之前我一直是坐在观众席上看C罗领奖。”
Five major titles for Barcelona last year -- leaving none for Ronaldo's Real Madrid -- brought the golden ball back into Messi's hands.
梅西2015年助巴萨加冕五冠王（西甲、欧冠、国王杯、欧洲超级杯、世俱杯）——这正是他获奖的原因。而C罗带领的皇马则颗粒无收。
Messi got 41.33 percent of total voting points in a 23-candidate ballot. Ronaldo received 27.76 percent and third-place Neymar, Messi's Barcelona teammate from Brazil, got 7.86 percent. Voting was by national team captains and coaches, plus invited journalists, from FIFA member countries.
共23人参与投票，梅西得票率达41.33%，C罗得票27.76%；梅西的巴萨队友、来自巴西的内马尔位列第三，得票7.86%。参与投票的都是各国家队队长、教练以及受邀的记者，全部来自国际足联成员国。
As usual, Argentina captain Messi and Portugal captain Ronaldo ignored each other on their own ballot papers. Messi voted for three Barcelona teammates and Ronaldo listed three Madrid colleagues.
跟往年一样，阿根廷队长梅西和葡萄牙队长C罗都没有投票给对方：梅西投给了三名巴萨队友，C罗投给了三名皇马同仁。
