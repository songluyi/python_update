Chinese actress and UN Refugee Agency Goodwill Ambassador Yao Chen was selected as one of the "Young Global Leaders" in 2016 by the World Economic Forum. 13 other Chinese were also on the list.
World Economic Forum is hoping that this year's Young Global Leaders can tackle the world's most complex and pressing challenges. Furthermore, those on the list are invited to join a community and a five-year leadership journey to "break down silos, bridge cultures and use their collective skills to get things done for positive impact across private, public and civil society organizations."
