China's annual consumer rights day TV show took aim at online food delivery apps, faked online sales and dodgy false teeth when it aired late on Tuesday, but the much-hyped program unusually failed to snag any major international firms.
But in an unusually low-key outing, the show's highest-profile target was food delivery app Ele.me. The food-ordering platform Ele.me was accused of partnering with unlicensed restaurants, mostly home kitchens, with poor sanitary conditions. The website also allegedly allowed restaurants to post false pictures and addresses that could mislead customers.
