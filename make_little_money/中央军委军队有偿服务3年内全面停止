The Central Military Commission (CMC) has planned to gradually terminate all paid services in the military in three years, according to a CMC circular recently issued.
The CMC also rolled out principles and measures on the termination of military paid services, aiming to tackle problems that may emerge as a result of the move to phase out paid services.
