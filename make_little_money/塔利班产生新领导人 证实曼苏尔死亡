Afghanistan’s Taliban says Mawlawi Haibatullah Akhundzada has been appointed the new chief of the group following the death of Mullah Akhtar Mansoor.
阿富汗塔利班说，已任命莫尔维·哈伊巴图拉·阿昆德扎达接替被打死的曼苏尔，担任该组织的领导人。
In a Pashto language statement on Wednesday, the Tailban also formally confirmed Mansoor was killed in a U.S. drone attack last week.
塔利班星期三用普什图语发表声明，证实曼苏尔死于美国上周发动的一次无人机空袭。
“Mawlawi Haibatullah Akhundzada has been appointed as the new leader of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban) after a unanimous agreement in the shura (the supreme council), and all the members of shura pledged allegiance to him,” the Taliban statement said.
塔利班在声明中说，该组织的最高委员会一致推举阿昆德扎达担任新领导人，并宣誓效忠于他。
U.S. President Barack Obama confirmed on Monday that Mansoor was eliminated because he was blocking Afghan peace and reconciliation efforts.
美国总统奥巴马星期一说，曼苏尔阻碍阿富汗的和平与和解进程，因此被除掉。
The new Taliban leader was a deputy to Mansoor along with Sirajuddin Haqqani, the leader of the notorious Haqqani network.
阿昆德扎达和哈卡尼网络的领袖哈卡尼都是曼苏尔的副手。
Haqqani has retained his position while the son of the group’s founder, Mullah Yaqoob, has been appointed as a second deputy to the new Taliban chief.
塔利班创始人的儿子毛拉·雅各布被任命为新领导人的第二副手，而哈卡尼仍担任第一副手。
