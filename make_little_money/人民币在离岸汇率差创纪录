The gap between the renminbi’s two exchange rates has widened to a record, fuelling speculation that Beijing intends to allow its currency to depreciate at a faster rate than previously seen.
人民币在岸与离岸汇率之差升至创纪录水平，这使得越来越多的人猜测，北京方面打算让人民币以前所未见的速度贬值。
The spread between the offshore market and the more tightly controlled onshore market is an embarrassment for the People’s Bank of China, which pledged in August to narrow the gap as part of its efforts to make its currency “freely usable”.
对中国央行来说，人民币离岸汇率与受到更为严格管控的在岸汇率之差是个尴尬的存在。中国央行去年8月承诺要缩小这一差值，以努力促成人民币的“可自由使用”。
Investors around the world are worried that an unexpectedly fast depreciation will destabilise China’s economy. Some also fear it could trigger a wave of competitive devaluations across the region.
世界各地的投资者担心，人民币出人意料的快速贬值会破坏中国经济的稳定。有些人还担心，这会在该地区引发一波竞争性贬值。
