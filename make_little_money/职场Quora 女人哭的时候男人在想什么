Whenever I see a woman crying the famous words from Matthew Henry start playing in my head.
每当我看到一个女人哭泣的时候，我脑海里都会想起马太·亨利的名言：
“Be careful if you make a women cry, because God counts her tears. The woman came out of a man’s ribs. Not from his feet to be walked on, not from his head to be superior, but from his side to be equal, under the arm to be protected, and next to the heart to be loved.”
“如果你让一个女人哭泣了，那你得小心哦，因为上帝都记着呢。女人是从男人的肋骨中诞生的。不是从他的脚下长出去而任他随意对待的，也不是从他的脑袋长出来而比他高一等。而是要站到他的身边和他平起平坐，在他的臂膀下被小心呵护，放在心里边儿被全心爱着。”
