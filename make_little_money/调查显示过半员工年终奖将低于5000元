Some 40 percent of respondents are not satisfied with the state of their year-end bonuses as Spring Festival, or China's Lunar New Year, approaches, according to a survey by China Youth Daily.
Su Xiaoxu, who works at a state-owned enterprise, says she expects almost no bonus because the stock market and policy were so volatile in 2015.
