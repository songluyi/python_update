Taiwan's legislature on Monday banned school canteens from using genetically modified (GM) food, such as vegetables or tofu.
In addition, an inspection will be led by the education, agriculture and health authorities every academic year to ensure schools and colleges adhere to the ruling, according to a statement issued by the legislature.
