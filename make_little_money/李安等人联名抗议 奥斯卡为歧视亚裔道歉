The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expressed its regret on last Tuesday after some Academy members protested the Oscars' Asian jokes, saying it will work to ensure the show is "cultural sensitive."
The letter said, "The Oscars show was marred by a tone-deaf approach to its portrayal of Asians." Then the Academy released a statement of apology.
