Shares in the French company fell by as much as 20 per cent after AFP, reported that Renault’s offices had been raided as part of an investigation linked to the VW emissions scandal.
法新社(AFP)有关雷诺(Renault)办公室遭到突击检查的消息传出之后，雷诺股价跌幅曾达20%之多。这次检查与大众(VW)排放丑闻相关联。
Companies are being asked whether they, like VW, installed so-called defeat devices in their diesel vehicles so as to understate emissions in official tests.
人们开始询问，车企们是否像大众一样在其柴油车上安装了所谓减效装置，以便在官方试验中减小排放量。
A 400-word statement from Renault confirmed the raids on company offices by French anti-fraud investigators last week, but also said that a government-appointed commission, having so far tested four of its cars, had yet to find any evidence of software-based defeat devices.
雷诺发表了一份400字的声明，证实公司在上周遭到了法国反欺诈调查机构的突击检查，但也表示，一家由政府指定的委员会，目前试验了4辆雷诺汽车之后，并未发现车上安装有软件控制的减效装置的任何证据。
Renault said the fact no such devices had been found in its vehicles was “good news”, but added that it had decided to “rapidly present an emissions plan which aims to strengthen the performance of its vehicles”.
雷诺表示，未在其汽车中发现此类装置是“好消息”，但补充称，已决定“尽快提出一份旨在提高雷诺汽车性能的排放方案”。
The independent commission is seeking to establish if domestic or foreign carmakers have installed defeat devices in their vehicles. It is due to test 100 cars by various carmakers — including 25 Renault models.
这家独立委员会正努力查证，国内外车企是否在汽车中安装了减效装置。该委员会将检测不同车企的100辆汽车，其中包括25辆雷诺汽车。
The International Council on Clean Transportation, which helped expose the VW scandal, said in September that Renault’s real-world nitrogen oxides emissions were “very poor” relative to laboratory results, and unfit for the on-the-road tests the European Union wants to introduce in 2017.
去年9月，帮助曝光大众丑闻的国际清洁运输委员会(International Council on Clean Transportation)表示，雷诺的实际氮氧化物排放量相对实验室结果“非常差”，不适合欧盟(EU)打算在2017年引入的道路试验。
