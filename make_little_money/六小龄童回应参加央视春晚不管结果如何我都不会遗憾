China Central Television is coming under pressure to involve a popular Chinese actor in this year's Spring Festival gala, with the internet demanding the man who is best known as the Monkey King be a part of this year's event.
Liu Xiao Ling Tong is the stage name of Zhang Jinlai. He rose to fame after starring as Sun Wukong in the 1986 television adaptation of the classic Chinese tale "Journey to the West." As such, most fully expected Zhang would be involved in the forthcoming Spring Festival gala, as this coming lunar year is the Year of the Monkey.
