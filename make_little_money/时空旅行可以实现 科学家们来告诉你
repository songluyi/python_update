Time travel is a familiar subject of science fiction and fantasy stories, from H.G. Wells to Rod Serling to Hot Tub Time Machine. But could time travel ever be possible in real life? And, if so, how would humans even handle a technology with such great capacity for destruction?
Essentially the closer you're going to the speed of light, the slower time moves. "Fly to the star Vega, 25 light years away, and back again at 99% of the speed of light, and when you return to Earth in 2062, you will have experienced only seven years' travel time in the spacecraft. In effect, you will have leaped 42 years into Earth's future," Davies wrote.
