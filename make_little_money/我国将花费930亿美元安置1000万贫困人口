China will spend 600 billion yuan (about $93 billion) in the next five years to relocate about 10 million impoverished people, an official said on Tuesday.
The document followed a high-profile conference on the issue in Beijing late in November, during which the leadership pledged measures to help lift the country's remaining 70 million poor people out of poverty by 2020.
