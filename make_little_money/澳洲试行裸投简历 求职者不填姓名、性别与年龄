In an Australian first, the Victorian government last Friday announced it would trial an 18-month program to strike out an applicant's name, gender, age and location from their resume.
Victoria's Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Robin Scott, has championed the initiative. His wife is of Chinese descent and has occasionally felt compelled to use her anglicized name, Jade Scott, to get job interviews. When using the pseudonym, the minister claimed his partner was more likely to progress to the next stage of the application process.
