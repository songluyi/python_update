The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the Ministry of Finance have jointly issued a notice on cutting social security premiums in the latest move to reduce enterprises' burdens.
The requirement for the rate of unemployment insurance payment, which was cut from 3% to 2% of the payroll last year, will be further reduced to 1-1.5%, with individuals' contribution capped by 0.5%.
