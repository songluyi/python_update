The United States’ Central Intelligence Agency tweeted the details of an operation that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden Sunday, drawing thousands of retweets and likes from apparent supporters while others responded with criticism.
美国中央情报局星期日在推特上公布击毙基地组织首领本拉登的行动细节，数千次被转发，有些网友表示支持，有些则提出批评。
The operation was the one President Barack Obama approved in May 2011 that involved special operations forces flying helicopters into a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan and later dumping bin Laden's body into the sea.
奥巴马总统于2011年5月批准了这项行动计划，命特种部队乘直升机进入位于巴基斯坦阿伯塔巴德的本拉登藏身地，后来又将本拉登的尸体抛进海里。
Twitter has been around since 2006, but the CIA is a relative newcomer with an account dating back just two years. The agency's 1,600 tweets usually involve its history, profiles of agents killed in service or public comments from current officials.
推特从2006年开始运作，而美国中情局两年前刚刚建立推特账号。中情局的1600条推特内容通常涉及中情局历史，以身殉职的特工的生平介绍，或是在职官员发表的公开评论。
But with the fifth anniversary of the bin Laden raid, the CIA announced it would "live" tweet the details as if they were happening again to its 1.3 million followers. Over the course of six hours, the tweets laid out the events that ultimately ended what had been a nearly decade-long search for the man whose organization killed nearly 3,000 people on September 11, 2001.
但在突袭本拉登行动5周年之际，中情局宣布要以“现场直播”的方式在推特上向130万关注者公布这一行动的细节。在先后6小时内，中情局在推特上展示了突袭行动的整个过程。这次行动最终结束了对本拉登历时将近十年的追捕。他领导的基地组织于2001年9月11日对美国发动恐怖袭击，造成近3000人死亡。
