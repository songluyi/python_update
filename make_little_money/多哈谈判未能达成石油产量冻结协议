 Attempts by some of the world’s biggest oil producers to freeze output ended without a deal on Sunday night, after Saudi Arabia insisted Iran should be part of any agreement.
 全球部分最大产油国冻结石油产量的企图未能在周日晚达成协议，原因是沙特阿拉伯坚称任何协议都必须有伊朗参与。
 Talks in Doha aimed at achieving the first global oil deal in 15 years, which had appeared to be on course earlier in the day, broke up late on Sunday night as ministers failed to overcome opposition from Riyadh, which had hardened its stance in recent days.
 在多哈举行的磋商旨在达成15年来首个全球石油协议，当天早些时候该协议似乎达成在望。然而周日晚上谈判却破裂了，原因是各国石油部长未能化解沙特政府的反对，后者的立场在最近几天变得强硬。
 The failure to reach an agreement risks setting off another drop in the oil price, with tensions between Saudi Arabia and its regional rival Iran proving too great to overcome.
 随着沙特和其地区对手伊朗之间的紧张被证明严重到难以克服的地步，未能达成协议可能引发油价新一轮跌势。
 Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada, Qatar’s energy minister, said: “We all need time for further consultation.”
 卡塔尔能源与工业大臣穆罕默德•本•萨利赫•萨达(Mohammed Bin Saleh al-Sada)表示：“我们都需要时间开展进一步磋商。”
 Delegates said Saudi Arabia had in effect torn up an earlier draft of the deal as it decided it could not be party to an agreement that would give Iran any leeway. Tehran had refused to join the freeze as it rebuilds its oil exports after years of sanctions.
 多名谈判代表表示，沙特实质上撕毁了早先的协议草案，该国下定决心不签署对伊朗没有约束力的协议。此前，伊朗政府拒绝在遭遇多年制裁后重建石油出口之际加入冻结石油产量的行列。
