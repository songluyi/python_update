Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Friday that the solution of the Iranian nuclear issue has provided inspiration for settlement of other hot issues, stressing dialogue and cooperation among major countries.
Iran reached the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action last year with the "P5+1," namely Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States and Germany, over its nuclear program after over 18 months of marathon talks.
