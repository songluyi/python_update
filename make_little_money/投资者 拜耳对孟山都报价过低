Investors are signalling that Bayer will have to increase its $62bn offer for Monsanto if the German group is to win the US agribusiness and complete the biggest all-cash takeover on record.
投资者表示，如果拜耳(Bayer)想要拿下孟山都(Monsanto)、完成这笔史上规模最大的全现金收购交易，这家德国集团将不得不增加对收购这家美国农业企业的620亿美元的报价。
A combination between the two would create the world’s largest supplier of seeds and agricultural chemicals, at a time when the sector is being reshaped by a wave of blockbuster deals.
两家合并将缔造全球最大的种子和农业化学品供应商，目前该行业正被一波重磅交易潮重塑。
Monsanto declined to comment on the offer, which many analysts expect it to reject as too low. The US company’s shares were trading up 5.27 per cent at $106.79 by early afternoon in New York, significantly below Bayer’s offer price. Bayer’s shares closed down 4.7 per cent.
孟山都拒绝就该报价置评，很多分析师预期它将拒绝该报价，称其太低。昨日午后，这家美国企业在纽约的股价上涨了5.27%，明显低于拜耳的收购报价。拜耳的股价收盘下跌4.7%。
However, Morningstar analyst Jeffrey Stafford said the fact Monsanto first saw the proposal on May 10 and had yet to respond could mean the board was “seriously considering the deal”.
然而，晨星(Morningstar)分析师杰弗里•斯塔福德(Jeffrey Stafford)称，孟山都首次看到收购要约是5月10日，至今尚未回应可能意味着董事会“正在认真考虑这笔交易”。
