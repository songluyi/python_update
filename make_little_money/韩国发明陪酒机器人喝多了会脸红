With this mechanical friend, you'll never have to drink alone!
The inspiration for Drinky came during a dateless Christmas which Park spent with a bottle of soju (the traditional Korean alcohol called shochu in Japan). During his solo drinking session, Park decided, on a whim, to pour a second glass and place it in front of himself, as though he were drinking with a friend. He found that doing so improved not only the atmosphere in the room, but also how he perceived the soju's flavor, and figured that even more benefits could be reaped with a robotic companion.
