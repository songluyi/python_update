US economic growth slowed to an annual pace of 0.5% during the first three months of the year. That was a sharp fall from the 1.4% rate of growth in the last quarter of 2015 and the slowest pace in two years.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy, increased at a rate of 1.9%, down from 2.4% in the previous quarter. Business investment fell by 5.9% - the biggest quarterly decline since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.
