A passenger from the hijacked EgyptAir flight who had the cheek to take a photograph with his captor is a 26-year-old British man from Leeds.
被劫持的埃及航空班机上，竟有一位乘客跟劫持者合影留念，让人大跌眼镜。这位乘客是一名26岁的英国人，家住利兹。
Benjamin Innes was one of the last captives to be released by Seif al-Din Mustafa during Tuesday's six-hour hijacking episode and took a picture with the man who claimed to be wearing a suicide vest.
在当地时间29日发生的6小时劫机事件中，本杰明·伊恩斯是最后一批被释放的遭劫持乘客之一。他与劫持者赛义夫丁·穆斯塔法拍了一张自拍。而劫持者此前自称穿着自杀式炸弹背心。
A photograph shows Mr Innes grinning broadly as he stands next to Mustafa in the cabin of the hijacked Airbus 320 as it sat on the runway of an airport in Cyprus.
照片显示，在机舱内，伊恩斯咧嘴微笑，与穆斯塔法并肩而立。彼时这架被劫持的空客320正在塞浦路斯一处机场停放着。
Friends and family of Mr Innes said the behaviour was typical of an irreverent young man who loves a joke.
伊恩斯的亲友们都认为，这种自拍就是一个心大、爱开玩笑的年轻人的典型行为。
Mr Innes told The Sun: "I'm not sure why I did it, I just threw caution to the wind while trying to stay cheerful in the face of adversity."
伊恩斯在接受《太阳报》采访时说：“我也不确定当时到底怎么想的，我就是觉得没什么可防备的，然后想在困境中找点乐子。”
"I got one of the cabin crew to translate for me and asked him if I could do a selfie with him."
“我找了个空乘给我当翻译，问他能不能跟他合个影。”
"He just shrugged OK so I stood by him and smiled for the camera while a stewardess did the snap. It has to be the best selfie ever."
“他说没问题啊，所以我就笑着跟他站在照相机前，一位空姐帮我们拍了照。这张自拍应该荣登史上最佳。”
Mustafa, a 59-year-old Egyptian man, sparked alerts across the planet when he told the cabin crew of EgyptAir flight 181 that he had a bomb and forced the aircraft to make an emergency landing at Cyprus's Larnaca airport.
穆斯塔法告诉埃及航空181次航班的机组人员，他身上有炸弹，引发了全球性恐慌，并迫使飞机紧急降落在塞浦路斯拉纳卡机场。59岁的穆斯塔法是埃及人。
But over the course of six strange hours, he issued a demand to see his Cypriot former wife and took pictures with Mr Innes before finally surrendering himself to police.
在此次尴尬的6小时劫机过程中，穆斯塔法的要求仅有一个，就是与自己的塞浦路斯籍前妻见面。另外还与伊恩斯合了影。之后就向警方投降了。
As one Egyptian official summed it up:"He's not a terrorist, he's an idiot."
正如一位埃及官员所言：“他不是恐怖分子，他就是个傻瓜。”
