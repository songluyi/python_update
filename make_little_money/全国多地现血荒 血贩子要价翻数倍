Several cases of illegal trade in human blood for transfusion were exposed in East China's Jiangsu Province on last Tuesday. The black-market deals are partly caused by the country's severe blood shortage, experts said, calling for an update to China's current blood donation laws.
"By national standards, 200cc of blood only costs around 210 yuan in hospitals," Wang Chuanxi, deputy chief of the Guangzhou Blood Center, told the Global Times, adding that the fee covers the cost of blood storage and processing.
