The Yangtze River Delta is set to build a global reputation for its cluster of cities by 2030 by focusing on high-end equipment manufacturing and modern services, the State Council said on last Wednesday.
To cultivate new momentum for economic growth and upgrade traditional industries, innovations should be strengthened in key areas of high-end manufacturing such as information technology, the biopharmaceutical industry, automobiles and new materials, according to a statement released after the meeting. Additionally, modern services such as finance, technological research and development, and logistics should be enhanced, it said.
