More than 100,000 people a year in Japan leave their jobs to care for sick elderly relatives, according to the government, and most of them remain unemployed after their death.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed in September to stem the flow, which he referred to as an "imminent crisis." In a speech, he set out targets for growing the economy to 600 trillion yen from the current 500 trillion yen, preventing the population from falling below 100 million from the current 127 million, and enabling as many people as possible to work, whatever their family responsibilities.
