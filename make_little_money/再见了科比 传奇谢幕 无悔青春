Playing in the last game of his 20-year career, Kobe Bryant put on a show for a sold-out Staples Center crowd one final time, pouring in a season-high 60 points and steering his team to a 101-96 comeback win over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night.
Bryant attempted 50 shots Wednesday night, the most taken by anyone in an NBA game in the past 30 seasons. It was the sixth 60-point game of his career and marked the most points scored by a player in his final regular-season game.
