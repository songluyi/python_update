Elite universities are to be established by the Ministry of Education in 14 central and western provinces that have never had a university directly under the ministry before, as part of the central government's pledge to bridge the widening education gap.
Chu Zhaohui, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Education Sciences, said that establishing more universities in central and western areas under the ministry's administration means increased access to educational resources and opportunities.
