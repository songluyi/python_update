 Kim Jong Un has ordered North Korea’s nuclear weapons to be placed on standby, ratcheting up tensions on the Korean peninsula following a UN Security Council approved tough new sanctions on the country.
 金正恩(Kim Jong Un)已命令朝鲜的核武器要处于值班状态。在联合国安理会(UN Security Council)批准对朝实施严厉的新一轮制裁后，朝鲜半岛紧张局势再度升级。
 The North Korean leader also said his country should turn its military posture to “pre-emptive attack” mode, the official Korean Central News Agency said on Friday.
 据朝鲜官方的朝中社(Korean Central News Agency)周五报道，朝鲜领导人金正恩还表示朝鲜的军事姿态要向着先发制人的方向转化。
 “The only way for defending the sovereignty of our nation and its right to existence under the present extreme situation is to bolster up nuclear force both in quality and quantity,” the KCNA quoted Mr Kim as saying. The news agency added that he had stressed the need for the country’s nuclear warheads to be “always on standby so as to be fired any moment”.
 朝中社援引金正恩的话称：“在当前的极端形势下，捍卫我们国家主权和生存权的唯一途径，只能是从质和量两方面加强核力量。”朝中社还表示，金正恩强调朝鲜的核弹头必须“做好随时发射的准备”。
 The UN Security Council voted on Wednesday to impose tougher sanctions on the Communist nation in response to North Korea’s fourth nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch earlier this year.
 联合国安理会周三表决通过对朝实施更严厉的制裁，以回应该国今年早些时候进行的第四次核试验以及远程导弹发射。
 Responding to the KCNA report, Bill Urban, a US defence department spokesman, said: “We urge North Korea to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.”
 美国国防部发言人比尔•厄本(Bill Urban)回应朝中社的报道称：“我们敦促朝鲜避免采取挑衅性行动来加剧紧张局势，而是应致力于履行其国际义务和承诺。”
 Mr Kim’s comments came ahead of joint military exercises between South Korea and the US this month, which Pyongyang sees as preparations for an invasion.
 金正恩是在本月韩国和美国举行联合军演前发表上述讲话的，平壤方面将此次军演视作入侵朝鲜的准备工作。
 “Now is the time for us to convert our mode of military counteraction toward the enemies into an pre-emptive attack one in every aspect,” Mr Kim was quoted as saying.
 朝中社援引金正恩的话表示：“对我们来说，现在是时候将我们的对敌军事应对全面转向先发制人模式了。”
