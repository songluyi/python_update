 Hanergy Thin Film, the Hong Kong-listed solar company whose soaring stock briefly turned its owner into China’s richest man, has reported a HK$12.2bn (US$1.5bn) loss for 2015.
 2015年，汉能薄膜发电(Hanergy Thin Film)录得122亿港元（合15亿美元）亏损。汉能薄膜发电是一家在香港上市的太阳能企业，其股价的飙升一度将其所有者推上中国首富宝座。
 The company, whose shares are suspended during an investigation into its finances by Hong Kong’s stock market regulator, reported that revenues over last year fell to HK$2.8bn from HK$9.6bn, reports Miles Johnson in London.
 该公司股票目前处于停牌状态，香港股市监管机构正对其财务状况展开调查。该公司财报显示，去年其营收从96亿港元降至28亿港元。
 Last year the Financial Times ran a series of investigations into HTF’s business model and accounting, which relied almost entirely on selling equipment to its parent company in mainland China.
 去年，英国《金融时报》对汉能薄膜发电的商业模式和会计操作展开了一系列调查，该公司的收入几乎完全依赖于向其内地母公司销售设备。
 Since then its value has collapsed, making the once high flying company a symbol for the excess in China’s stock market. Owner Li Hejun’s Hanergy parent company has since warned bondholders that it is likely to default on debt payments.
 该公司的价值自那时起已大幅缩水，这家曾经极为成功的公司由此成为中国股市泡沫的一个象征。其所有者李河君旗下的母公司汉能集团(Hanergy)还提醒该集团的债券持有人称，该集团可能会拖欠债务偿付。
 HTF’s loss was driven by HTF writing off HK$7.9bn of good will from its balance sheet, but the company did not explain in its earnings statement why it decided to do so.
 汉能薄膜发电的亏损主要源自其资产负债表中发生了79亿港元的商誉减值，但该公司在其财报中并未解释它为何决定这么做。
