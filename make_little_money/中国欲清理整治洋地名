China is planning to introduce new restrictions on place names because of concerns that too many fail to reflect national culture.
担心越来越多的地名未能体现中国文化，中国政府拟规范地名乱象。
The country's civic affairs minister, Li Liguo, wants anyone naming sites such as bridges, buildings and roads to take inspiration from Chinese history, instead of opting for foreign names like "Manhattan Plaza", Beijing News reports. Existing names which fall foul of the requirements will also be changed, according to the paper.
据《新京报》报道，民政部部长李立国希望人们在给路桥建筑起名字时，能够从中国历史中汲取灵感，尽量避免出现像“曼哈顿广场”这样的洋地名。
Mr Li says cleaning up place names will strengthen and standardise cultural protection, and promote China's cultural heritage. He's in charge of a State Council survey of geographical names, an effort which started in 2014 and has another two years to run.
李立国表示，清理洋地名会加强对中国文化的保护，弘扬中华文明，有利于推广文化遗产。他领导的国务院小组，2014年起开始对全国地名进行普查，此次地名普查将持续到2018年。
According to the Xinhua news agency, the first places to be renamed will be any that "damage national dignity" or conflict with core socialist values, as well as those which have attracted the most public complaints. Places which promise more than they deliver are also in the government's sights—so anywhere adopting Venice as part of its name will need to have more than just a pond, the agency notes.
根据新华社的报道，首批需要接受整改的包括那些“有损民族尊严的”，与社会主义核心价值观冲突的，以及引发公众极大争议的地名。同时，那些过分夸大配套功能的也需要改名。该报道举例称，比如一个自称“威尼斯”的地方，只有一个池塘是不够的。
Social media users are divided on the issue, with some pointing out that foreign names are often chosen as a way of celebrating ties with other cities or countries. There's plenty of support, though, with one person writing: "They really should change, or else we'll feel there are no Chinese historical elements!"
社交媒体用户对此褒贬不一。有的说，洋地名就是为了显示自己跟别国或别国的城市有些关联。但也有不少支持的网友。其中一人说道：“是应该改改了，不然我们还以为中国就没有什么历史古韵呢！”
