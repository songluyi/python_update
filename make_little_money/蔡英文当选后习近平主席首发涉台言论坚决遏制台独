Beijing will "resolutely curb" secessionist activities seeking "Taiwan independence" in any form, and will never let the historic tragedy of "national separation" recur, President Xi Jinping said on Saturday.
He said the 1992 Consensus, which says both Taiwan and the mainland are parts of one China, explicitly defines the nature of the cross-Straits relationship and is crucial to the stable and long-term development of cross-Straits ties. Only by acknowledging the 1992 Consensus, and accepting its core content, can the two sides have a common political foundation and maintain healthy interactions.
