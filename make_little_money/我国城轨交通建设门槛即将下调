China is mulling to lower the threshold for cities applying for urban rail transport construction, a move that analysts say may draw more than one trillion yuan investment while bolstering ailing economic growth.
An action plan, issued earlier by China's top economic planner National Reform and Development Commission together with the Ministry of Transport, noted that total investments on transportation by 2018 will reach 4.7 trillion yuan - about 34 percent will go to new urban rails.
