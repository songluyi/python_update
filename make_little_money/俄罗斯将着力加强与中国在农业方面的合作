Russia hopes to strengthen agricultural cooperation with China, Russian Agriculture Minister Alexander Tkachev said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
"Our main priority in the Far East is to provide the conditions for investment in agricultural and infrastructure spheres," Tkachev said, naming several regions such as Primorsky, Khabarovsk, Amur and Sakhalin, which border with or are in the vicinity of China's northeast.
