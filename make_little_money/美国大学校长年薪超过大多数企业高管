College presidents on average earn $377,261 annually, or more than twice the average pay for CEOs, who take home about $176,840 on average each year, according to new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
Not every college president is pulling in the big bucks, however. Leaders at research universities earn much higher compensation than rivals at colleges that only offer bachelor's degrees. Presidents at research universities are pulling in an average of $1.18m, compared with $280,974 for presidents at four-year institutions focusing on the arts and sciences.
