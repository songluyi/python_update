Japan and South Korea have reached a historic deal to settle the issue of "comfort women" forced to work in Japanese brothels during World War Two. Japan offered an apology and will pay 1bn yen (8.3m USD, 5.6m Pound) to a South Korean-administered fund for victims.
After the meeting Mr Kishida told reporters that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe offered a heartfelt apology. "Abe, as the prime minister of Japan, offers from his heart an apology and reflection for everyone who suffered lots of pain and received scars that are difficult to heal physically and mentally," he said.
