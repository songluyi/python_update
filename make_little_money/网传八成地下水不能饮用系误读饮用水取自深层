China's deep underground drinking water sources are safe, an official at the Ministry of Water Resources said on Monday in response to a news report suggesting that more than 80 percent of the water in China's aquifers is too polluted for human consumption.
Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a non-governmental environmental protection organization, said most cities in China are using water from deep underground - which is not easily contaminated - for drinking.
