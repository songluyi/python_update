China's Dark Matter Particle Explorer Satellite was successfully launched at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Gansu province on Thursday. At 8:12 am, the carrier Long March 2-D rocket blasted off, sending the satellite into the sun-synchronous orbit.
Designed in the shape of a one-cubic-meter box weighing 1.9 metric tons, DAMPE carries four probes that coordinate with each other to search for signs of dark matter, which gives the satellite the widest observation spectrum and highest energy resolution of any dark matter probe in the world.
