While Turkey says it has reached its "capacity to absorb" refugees, Turkish aid workers are providing tents and supplies for Syrian refugees who have gathered at the border between the two countries.
尽管土耳其表示其接纳难民的能力已经饱和，土耳其援助人员仍在为叙利亚难民提供帐篷和其他补给，这些难民目前滞留在土叙边界。
Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told CNN-Turk television Sunday Turkey has already taken in 3 million refugees, the vast majority of them Syrians.
土耳其副总理库尔图尔穆什星期日对美国有线电视新闻网说，土耳其已经收容了300万难民，其中绝大多数是叙利亚人。
Turkey has closed its Oncupinar border opposite Syria's Bab al-Samam frontier where thousands of Syrians massed Sunday for a third day waiting for the border to open. Turkish officials say up to 35,000 Syrians are waiting at the border. The Syrians are escaping a Russia-backed government offensive in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
土耳其关闭了进入叙利亚的奥库皮纳尔过境点，成千上万叙利亚人星期日已是连续第3天滞留那里，等待重开边界。土耳其官员说，在边界等候的叙利亚人多达3万5千人。这些叙利亚人是为了逃离得到俄罗斯支持的叙利亚政府军对阿勒颇的进攻。
It was not immediately clear, however, what has to happen before the crossing is opened.
目前还不清楚，土耳其在什么情况下才会重开边界。
