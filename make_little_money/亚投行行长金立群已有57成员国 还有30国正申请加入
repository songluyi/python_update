There are more than 30 countries waiting to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), in addition to its 57 founding members, the bank's president Jin Liqun said on Friday.
Existing financial institutions can not fully meet every nation's infrastructure and other demands, so new ones like the AIIB will be a great help, Jin said.
