The Obama administration told China on Thursday that its approach for dealing with North Korea had “not worked”, as Congress readied a new round of sanctions on the regime in Pyongyang that could hit Chinese banks.
奥巴马(Obama)政府周四向中国表示，中国与朝鲜打交道的方式“没起作用”。美国国会准备对朝鲜政权实施新一轮制裁，此举可能会波及中国的银行。
A day after North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test, John Kerry, US secretary of state, raised diplomatic pressure on China, saying that Beijing could not “continue business as usual” with its ally in Pyongyang.
朝鲜进行第四次核试验的一天后，美国国务卿约翰克里(John Kerry)对中国施加了更大的外交压力。他表示，北京方面不能“再按照以往的做法与其在平壤的盟友打交道”。
“China had a particular approach that it wanted to take and we agreed to give them the space to be able to implement that, but today...I made it very clear that has not worked,” Mr Kerry said about a phone call on Thursday with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.
周四，克里与中国外长王毅通了电话。在谈到此次通话时，克里表示：“以往中国有一套他们想采取的特殊做法，我们也同意给他们空间、让他们能够去贯彻这些做法，但今天……我十分明确地表示，那套做法没起作用。”
The latest nuclear test has left the Obama administration facing the perpetual dilemma of its North Korea policy: how to change China’s calculations about the risk of a North Korean nuclear bomb.
朝鲜的这次核试验让奥巴马政府不得不去面对其对朝政策的一个永恒难题：如何改变中国对朝鲜拥核风险的考量？
Although China has been strongly critical of the nuclear test — as it has on the previous three occasions — Chinese leaders have consistently concluded that the greater risk they face is a collapse of the regime in North Korea.
尽管中国对这次核试验持强烈批评态度——前三次它也是这个态度——但中国领导人始终认为，他们面对的更大风险是朝鲜政权的崩溃。
