China says it is investigating a group of Taiwanese nationals deported from Kenya for suspected fraud, pushing back against angry protests from Taipei over the deportations.
中国说，目前正在对因涉嫌欺诈而被肯尼亚遣送到中国的一些台湾人展开调查。
A total of 45 Taiwanese nationals have been sent to mainland China between Monday and Tuesday, all of them arrested in Kenya in 2014 and charged with cybercrime. A Kenyan court dismissed the charges and gave the group 21 days to leave the country.
在星期一和星期二，共有45名台湾人被遣送到中国大陆，他们都是2014年在肯尼亚被逮捕，并被控从事网络犯罪。一家肯尼亚法院撤销了对他们的指控，但命令他们在21天内离境。
Taipei has angrily accused Beijing of kidnapping its nationals by pressuring Kenya to deport them to China. But An Fengshan, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said the group had stolen millions of dollars from Chinese citizens and businesses.
台北愤怒指责北京通过要求肯尼亚将台湾公民遣送中国的方式对他们进行绑架。但中国国台办发言人安锋山说，这些台湾人从中国公民和企业诈骗了巨额钱财。
Kenyan police forcibly removed 15 Taiwanese nationals from a police station Tuesday after they refused to leave for the flight to China.
星期二，15名台湾人拒绝乘飞机前往中国，肯尼亚警察将他们强行带离警局。
