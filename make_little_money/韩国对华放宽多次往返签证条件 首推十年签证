South Korea started relaxing visa requirements for Chinese citizens Thursday, aiming to attract more Chinese tourists. South Korea cuts the age of Chinese tourists who are eligible for multiple entry visas to 55 from 60.
We advise you not to overstay your visit at all costs. If you cannot avoid an overstay, however, you will most likely be fined an amount that costs more than a visa extension, visa run or new visa. In most cases, you will not be thrown in jail.
