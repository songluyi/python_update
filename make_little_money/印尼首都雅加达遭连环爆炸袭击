A series of bomb blasts have rocked the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, followed by gun battles on the streets.
Images from Jakarta have showed several bodies lying on the road outside a cafe, as well as seriously injured people being carried away. Details remain unclear, but at least one of the blasts hit a Starbucks cafe outside the Sarinah shopping centre. Eyewitnesses say several attackers entered the cafe and detonated explosives. Gunfire broke out after police arrived at the scene and there were several further explosions.
