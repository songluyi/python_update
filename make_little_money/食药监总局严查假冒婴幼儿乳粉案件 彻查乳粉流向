China's top food safety regulator demanded on Monday a thorough investigation into the whereabouts of 17,000 cans of fake-brand baby formula－which have been sold nationwide－to eliminate risks.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate said on its website in March that six people were arrested in Shanghai in January for producing and selling the fake-brand formula, from which they profited by nearly 2 million yuan ($310,000).
