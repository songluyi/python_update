Nearly a decade ago, computer security experts found a new kind of malicious software that would eventually infect more than 1 million computers in the United States and Europe and cause tens of millions of dollars in damages.
近10年前，电脑安全专家发现了一种新型恶意软件，可使美国和欧洲的100多万台电脑受到感染，造成的损失高达数千万美元。
On Monday, a U.S. federal court sentenced Russian national Nikita Kuzmin on charges of conspiracy, bank fraud and computer intrusion for creating the software, named Gozi, and selling it to hackers who used it to steal money from bank accounts.
星期一，美国一家联邦法院对俄罗斯公民库兹敏进行宣判，他的罪名包括阴谋，银行欺诈、创造Gozi软件入侵电脑并把这种软件卖给黑客，使他们得以盗取银行账户中的存款。
Prosecutors said Kuzmin "committed this crime purely out of greed" and helped pioneer a new kind of cybercrime that has become more prevalent in recent years.
检察官说，库兹敏犯罪完全是出于贪婪，并促成了一种新型网络犯罪，而这种犯罪近年来变得更加猖獗。
Prosecutors said security experts identified 10,000 account records from more than 5,200 people, which included login information for accounts with hundreds of companies. The infected computers included hundreds at the U.S. space agency NASA.
检察人员说，电脑安全专家确认，5200多人的一万个账户被入侵，涉及数百家公司账户的登录信息。被感染的电脑里也包括美国航空航天局的数百台电脑。
Kuzmin said he did not partake in stealing bank account information himself. He made money by renting use of Gozi to others and by collecting a portion of whatever they later stole with it. According to court documents, Kuzmin estimated he made at least $250,000.
库兹敏说，他没有参与盗取银行账户信息，而是靠出租Gozi软件，然后从赃款中提成。法庭文件显示，估计库兹敏通过这种方式获利至少25万美元。
The court said Kuzmin's punishment is the 37 months he has already spent in prison, as well as paying $6.9 million that authorities have identified as the losses incurred by two banks in the U.S. and one in Europe.
法庭宣布，库兹敏被关押的37个月就是他的刑期，他还被罚款690万美元，相当于两家美国银行和一家欧洲银行受到的损失。
