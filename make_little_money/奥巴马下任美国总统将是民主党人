U.S. President Barack Obama has told fellow party members he is certain a Democrat will be the next president of the United States.
美国总统奥巴马告诉民主党人说，他确信下任美国总统将是民主党人。
Speaking Thursday in Baltimore, just north of Washington, the president said, "Democrats will win in November and we will have a Democratic president succeeding me - just in case there's any confusion about that."
奥巴马星期四在美国首都华盛顿以北的巴尔的摩表示，民主党人将赢得11月的总统大选，一位民主党总统将接替他的职位，这一点毋需置疑。
Obama said he was confident of his prediction because Democrats "focus on the things that matter in the lives of American people."
奥巴马说，他之所以相信这一预言会实现，是因为民主党人把注意力集中在与美国人民生活息息相关的问题上。
Obama, in a jab against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, said that "We're not going to strengthen our leadership around the world by allowing politicians to insult Muslims or pit groups of Americans against each other."
奥巴马抨击共和党总统参选人川普。他说，如果容许政界人士侮辱穆斯林或挑起美国各群体之间的对抗，就不能加强美国在世界上的领导地位。
