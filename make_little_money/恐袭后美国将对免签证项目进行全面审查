U.S. senators welcomed an overhaul of America's visa waiver program contained in a massive federal spending bill expected to pass both legislative houses in the coming days.
美国参议员欢迎对免签证项目进行全面审查, 这一计划包含在预计未来数天内将获得通过的大规模联邦开支法案中。
Once approved, the measures would constitute the full Congress' first concrete steps to boost domestic security following the terrorist attacks in Paris and California.
一旦获得通过，这些举措将使得美国国会首次可以采取切实步骤来加强国内安全。此前，在法国巴黎和美国加州接连发生了恐怖袭击。
Under the overhaul, most nationals from more than three dozen countries would retain the ability to travel to the United States without a visa. They would be excluded from the program, however, if they have traveled to Syria, Iraq, Iran or Sudan in the last five years.
按照这项全面审查计划，来自30多个国家的绝大多数公民将保持免签证前往美国的能力。但是如果他们在过去5年中曾经前往叙利亚、伊拉克、伊朗或者苏丹，他们会被排除在这个项目之外。
The legislation also aims to strengthen information-sharing among governments, and empowers the Department of Homeland Security to terminate a country's participation in the visa waiver program if its data sharing is deemed inadequate.
这项立法还旨在加强各国政府之间的信息情报共享，授权美国国土安全部在数据分享缺乏的情况下，中止某个国家免签证的资格。
The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the changes last week. Attaching them to a massive yearlong spending bill will help speed them to President Barack Obama's desk to be signed into law.
美国国会众议院上周以压倒性多数批准了这些调整变动。把这个审查项目加入大规模的年度开支法案之中，将有助于使之加速被奥巴马总统签署成为法律。
