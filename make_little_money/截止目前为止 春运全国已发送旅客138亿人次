China's Spring holiday rush has so far accomplished 1.38 billion trips, a 3.3 percent growth from last year, according to the country's Ministry of Transportation on Saturday.
A new trend has also emerged in China during this year's Spring Festival, when more migrant workers from the country's less developed inland areas preferred to find jobs in adjacent provinces rather than to travel to megacities like Beijing and Shanghai. Experts have attributed this to the rising cost of living in the country's first-tier cities and the growing demand for labor in central and western China.
