The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council announced Wednesday it has labeled the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah a terrorist organization.
由六个成员国组成的海湾阿拉伯国家合作委员会星期三宣布，把黎巴嫩激进组织真主党列为恐怖组织。
GCC Secretary-General Abdullatif al-Zayani said the move is linked to Hezbollah's attempts to recruit young people in GCC countries to carry out terrorist acts, smuggle weapons and explosives, and incite disorder and violence.
海合会秘书长阿卜杜拉提夫·扎耶尼说，这么做是因为真主党试图在海合会成员国中招募年轻人从事恐怖活动，走私武器和爆炸物，以及煽动骚乱和暴力。
He said Hezbollah actions in Syria, Yemen and Iraq are not compatible with moral and humanitarian values and pose a threat to Arab national security.
他说，真主党在叙利亚、也门和伊拉克的行动与道德和人道主义价值观背道而驰，对阿拉伯国家的安全构成威胁。
The GCC is made up of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The group previously imposed sanctions on Hezbollah for its support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and sending militants into Syria to fight alongside the army.
海湾阿拉伯国家合作委员会曾因真主党支持叙利亚总统阿萨德并派遣激进分子进入叙利亚配合政府军作战而对它实施过制裁。
