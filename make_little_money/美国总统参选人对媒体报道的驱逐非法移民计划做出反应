Clinton's primary Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, said Thursday that he is "very disturbed" by the reports.

The Republican front-runner, real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump, took credit for the news in a Tweeted reaction, saying the deportation plan is being considered because he pressured the government to do it. "It's about time!" he said.
