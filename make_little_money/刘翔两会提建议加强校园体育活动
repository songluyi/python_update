"The deterioration of children's fitness levels has been a pressing issue in society, and has also drawn attention from the sports circle. Promoting the role of physical education in schools needs to be given greater importance," Liu, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said on Thursday.
Due to a heel injury that sidelined him from the Olympics finals in Beijing 2008 and London 2012, Liu announced his retirement last April. The 32-year-old Shanghai native said he could now spend more time promoting youth sports participation.
