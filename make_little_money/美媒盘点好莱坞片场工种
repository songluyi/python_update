Actor (male or female): If you are lucky, the only people who show up on screen when your film is finished.
Associate Producer: To quote David Mamet from State and Main,"[The credit is] what you give your secretary instead of a raise."
Assistant Director (AD): If the director steers the ship, the AD makes sure he has the tools to do it. The AD sets the schedule and tries their VERY best to keep everyone on it.
Catering/Craft Service: They hold the cast and crew in their hands by keeping them fed, hydrated, caffeinated, and happy. For those that behave, they may also keep a small stash of your favorite treats hidden away on your rough days.
DP/Director of Photography/Cinematographer: Runs the camera crew to make the visual and lighting magic—hopefully, super well supported by the grip and electric department. Some even throw that camera on their shoulder and operate. Sometimes while doing so they fall down. It's funny.
Executive Producer: Up for grabs. The money person, the idea person, the line producer, the agent, or manager for the writer/director/actor or someone with the golden ticket.
Production Assistant (PA): Does just what the job says—assists the production in a variety of ways. They always carry a walkie talkie. They're also the first person you should befriend on set because they can get you what you need—whatever that is.
Production Designer: The person responsible for the overall look of the film. They chat with the director and bring (with the help of a sizable art department) that vision to life.
Production Supervisor: It can be SO many different things. But the best ones are like ghosts because they do all the things that need to get done and no one even notices they needed doing.
Script Supervisor: Watches everyone like a hawk. It is their job to monitor action, wardrobe, props, set dressing, and hair and makeup on screen.
