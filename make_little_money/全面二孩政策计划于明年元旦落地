All couples in China are encouraged to have two children, according to a draft amendment to China's national law on population and family planning proposed to China's top legislature for review on Monday.
Relaxation of the family planning policy is expected to provide part of the solution to the challenge of an aging population, and to become a new driver for the economy in the long run.
