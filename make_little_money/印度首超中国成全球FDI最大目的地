 Despite China’s slowing growth and commensurate decrease in inward foreign direct investment, which has had a knock-on effect on regional flows, Asia-Pacific is clinging to its global FDI crown.
 尽管中国经济增速放缓且外商直接投资(FDI)相应下滑（这对地区投资流动产生了连锁反应），但亚太地区仍蝉联全球FDI冠军。
 The region soaked up 45 per cent of all greenfield investment globally in 2015, according to a report from fDi Intelligence, an FT data division. Foreign companies sited 3,883 greenfield investment projects in Asia-Pacific last year, totalling an estimated $302.5bn.
 根据英国《金融时报》旗下数据部门fDi Intelligence的一份报告，2015年，亚太地区吸引了全球45%的绿地项目投资。去年，外国公司将3883个绿地投资项目设在亚太地区，据估计投资总额为3025亿美元。
 Although the number of greenfield projects locating in Asia-Pacific last year declined 7 per cent from 2014’s tally, the total capital investment increased 29 per cent on the back of large increases in markets such as India, Indonesia and Pakistan.
 尽管去年亚太地区的绿地项目数量较2014年减少7%，但资本投资总额增长29%，这得益于印度、印尼和巴基斯坦等国的大幅增长。
 For the first time in many years, China was a laggard on regional FDI growth rather than an engine: it saw a 23 per cent decline in capital investment and a 16 per cent drop in FDI projects due to plateauing economic growth and rising costs.
 中国多年来首次拖累地区FDI增长，而不再是增长引擎：受经济增长趋缓且成本上升的影响，中国的资本投资下滑23%，FDI项目减少16%。
 It was knocked off its pedestal by India, which supplanted China as the world’s top destination for capital investment thanks to a number of mega investments throughout the year.
 把中国推下神坛的是印度，由于2015年全年大型投资项目很多，印度超过中国，成为全球资本投资头号目的地。
 In the report, India comes out as the highest-ranked country by greenfield capital investment, with $63bn of FDI announced in 2015. Project numbers increased 8 per cent to 697, although that still trails China’s 789 projects.
 在这份报告中，印度脱颖而出，摘得绿地项目资本投资排行榜的桂冠，2015年公布的FDI投资高达630亿美元。印度FDI项目数量增加8%，达到697个，尽管仍落后于中国的789个。
 Capital investment into Indonesia climbed 130 per cent to $38.5bn as a result of multiple large projects in the metals, chemicals and energy sectors, while Pakistan saw a 147 per cent increase to $18.9bn thanks to major energy-sector investments.
 流入印尼的资本投资增长130%，至385亿美元，这得益于金属、化工和能源行业的多个大型项目，同时，得益于能源行业的重大投资项目，巴基斯坦的资本投资增长147%，至189亿美元。
 Other Asian countries seeing growth were the Philippines (project numbers up 16 per cent) and Thailand (up 7 per cent). But FDI in Asia-Pacific is top-heavy, with the top three destination countries for capital investment — India, China and Indonesia — accounting for nearly half of all investment into the region.
 其他资本投资出现增长的亚洲国家包括菲律宾（项目数量增加16%）和泰国（项目数量增加7%）。但亚太地区的FDI有些头重脚轻，最大的三个目的地国家（印度、中国和印尼）占流向亚太地区投资总量的近一半。
 Meanwhile, a few pleasant surprises appeared in the FDI figures of previously struggling emerging Europe. The region encompassing Russia, the CIS countries and central, eastern and south-eastern Europe was the only world region to experience an increase in FDI across project numbers (+6 per cent), capital investment (+12 per cent) and jobs created through FDI (+13 per cent).
 与此同时，一些之前步履维艰的欧洲新兴国家的FDI数据带来了一些惊喜。该地区包括俄罗斯、独联体国家以及中欧、东欧和东南欧，是全球唯一一个在项目数量（增加6%）、资本投资总额（增长12%）和通过FDI创造的就业数量（增加13%）都出现增长的地区。
 Even though their FDI figures tracked downward in the first part of the year and despite geopolitical tensions swirling around both of them, Russia and Turkey closed the year with stronger than expected performances. Russia attracted 7 per cent of estimated capital investment into Europe, at $11.6bn, and project numbers recorded by fDi Intelligence for the country were 33 per cent greater than in 2014. Turkey attracted $5.8bn and saw a 47 per cent increase in project numbers year on year.
 尽管去年上半年俄罗斯和土耳其的FDI数据出现下滑，而且两国周边都出现地缘政治紧张局势，但两国去年的最终表现好于预期。据fDi Intelligence估计，俄罗斯吸引的投资占流入欧洲的资本投资总额的7%，达到116亿美元，该国吸引的项目数量比2014年增加33%。土耳其吸引了58亿美元的资本投资，项目数量同比增加47%。
 TheMiddle East and Africa as a combined region remained flat, with a 6 per centincrease in project numbers into Africa balancing out decreases in the MiddleEast. Africa received 156 more projects than the Middle East, although theUnited Arab Emirates remained the top destination in the region by projectnumbers, accounting for nearly a quarter of the Middle East and Africa’s total.
 作为一个合并地区，中东和非洲在绿地投资方面与前一年持平，流入非洲的项目数量增加6%，抵消了中东项目数量的减少。非洲吸引的项目数量比中东多156个，尽管按照项目数量衡量，阿联酋仍是该地区最大目的地，占中东和非洲项目总量的近四分之一。
 Egyptretained its position as the top destination by capital investment in theregion with $14.5bn recorded in 2015, despite a 19 per cent decrease in capex.Meanwhile, its project numbers increased 14 per cent.
 埃及仍是该地区最大的资本投资目的地，2015年共吸引145亿美元的投资，尽管资本支出减少19%。与此同时，该国项目数量增加14%。
 LatinAmerica and the Caribbean was the worst performing region last year. Capitalinvestment declined to $70.2bn and project numbers dropped 13 per cent; and ofthe region’s top ten destination countries, only three — Chile, Bolivia andJamaica — enjoyed growth in capital investment. After an exceptionally difficultyear, Brazil managed to keep its capital investment levels flat with only a 0.2per cent decline, but project numbers fell 17 per cent.
 拉美和加勒比地区是去年表现最差的地区。资本投资下滑至702亿美元，项目数量减少13%；在该地区前10大目的地国家中，只有3个国家（智利、玻利维亚和牙买加）的资本投资出现增长。在经历了格外艰难的一年后，巴西的资本投资总算与前一年持平，仅轻微下滑0.2%，但项目数量减少17%。
 Globally,capital investment increased nearly 9% in 2015 to $713bn, but project numbersdeclined 7% to 11,930.
 从全球来说，2015年的资本投资增长近9%，达到7130亿美元，但项目数量减少7%，为1.193万个。
