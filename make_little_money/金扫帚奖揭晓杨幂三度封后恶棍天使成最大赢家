The Golden Broom Awards, China's equivalent of the Razzie Awards, held its seventh annual ceremony on last Sunday in Beijing. A few blockbusters and A-list stars were given awards, yet none of the celebrities were in attendance.
Taking home three awards, including "most disappointing scriptwriter" and "most disappointing actor," Devil and Angel was the biggest "winner" at the Golden Broom Awards. Meanwhile, popular actress Yang Mi was given the "most disappointing actress" award for her third year straight.
