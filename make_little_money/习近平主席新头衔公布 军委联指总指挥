Chinese state media unveiled a new title for President Xi Jinping calling him "commander in chief" of the country's new joint forces battle command centre, as he seeks to consolidate power over the military.
The military should be "absolutely loyal", he said during his visit, the official news agency Xinhua reported. The military should be "resourceful in fighting, efficient in commanding and courageous and capable of winning wars", Xi said.
