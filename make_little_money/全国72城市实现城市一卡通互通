A total of 72 cities in China are increasingly well connected through the use of a one-card pass as the country pushes for smart city initiatives, Beijing Youth Daily reported on Wednesday.
The ministry launched the system in 2012, attracting eight cities -- Shanghai, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Huzhou, Taizhou, Changshu, Lanzhou and Baiyin -- to adopt the system by July that year.
