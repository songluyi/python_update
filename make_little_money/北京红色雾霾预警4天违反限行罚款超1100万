Beijing drivers could face a total of $1.6min fines for breaking driving restrictions during the city's pollution red alert, Chinese media say. Restrictions during the alert meant cars could only be driven on alternate days, depending on whether its number plate ended in an odd or even number.
The four-day alerts trigger restrictions on factory and construction work, and barbecues, among other things.
