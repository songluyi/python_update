China's top pricing regulator is to introduce a more flexible method for pricing domestic fuel, with adjustments allowed if the international oil price fluctuates between $40 and $140 per barrel.
Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, said, "Market-based pricing of liquefied petroleum gas is a good starting point. With sufficient supply and increased production capacity of domestic enterprises, the government will be able to see how this is implemented and further extend the pricing systems to other areas.
