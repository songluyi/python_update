The race to be the next president of the United States has its most important day so far Tuesday as candidates compete in 13 states. Those trailing in polls hope to make major moves to catch a pair of frontrunners who lead by double digits.
本周二是美国总统竞选至今最重要的一天，参选人要在13个州的初选中展开较量。在民调中落后的参选人希望在这天的初选中有重大斩获，追上以两位数领先的竞争对手。
Tuesday is hugely important for Republicans with businessman Donald Trump riding a three-state winning streak and favored in 10 of the so-called "Super Tuesday" states. Trump trails only in the southern state of Texas, where Senator Ted Cruz hopes to capture his home turf.
星期二对共和党参选人川普意义重大，他此前已连续在3场初选中获胜，并在参加所谓“超级星期二”的10个州的民调中居领先地位。川普只在德克萨斯州落后于来自该州的联邦参议员克鲁兹。
The key will not be how many states Trump wins, but how well Cruz and fellow Senator Marco Rubio perform.
超级星期二的看点不在于川普能拿下几个州，而在于克鲁兹和佛罗里达州联邦参议员鲁比奥的表现如何。
In the Democratic race, a CNN/ORC poll released Monday showed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton widening her national lead over Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 55 to 38 percent. Clinton also has a huge lead in the Democratic delegates awarded so far.
在民主党方面，美国有线电视新闻网和民意研究公司星期一公布的联合民调结果显示，前国务卿希拉里·克林顿对佛蒙特州联邦参议员桑德斯的领先优势扩大到了55%比38%。到目前为止，希拉里·克林顿获得的民主党代表票数也远远超过桑德斯。
