IKEA Group, the Swedish self-assembly budget furniture chain, is joining a growing number of multinational retailers aiming to tap China's online market.
Before the company enters more second- and third-tier cities in China, "we hope we can let consumers enjoy IKEA's products anywhere and at any time via various channels," said Xu. "E-commerce is a very good complement to IKEA's traditional sales channel".
