A restaurant that serves Japanese ramen made by two robot "chefs" became a hit when it opened on Thursday in Shanghai, icpress.cn reported.
The one million yuan price tag is about the same as it would cost Liu to employ two human chefs for six years. That's possibly the reason for the 58 yuan price tag on a bowl of ramen at his restaurant, which is about twice the price at another chain.
