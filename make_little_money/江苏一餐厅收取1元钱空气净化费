A restaurant in eastern China has been caught charging customers an "air cleaning fee" on top of their food bills.
The restaurant's owners recently purchased an air filtration system to improve the dining experience, and covered the cost by passing it on to customers without prior warning, the report says. But after complaints from angry patrons, the local government intervened to stop the practice, telling the owners that it constituted an illegal charge. A city official tells Xinhua that it wasn't the diners' choice to breathe filtered air, so it could not be sold as a commodity.
