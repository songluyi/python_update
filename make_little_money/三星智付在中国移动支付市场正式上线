South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co on Tuesday announced the launch of its mobile payment service in China, where it is likely to struggle in an already crowded market.
Samsung said its service currently supports selected credit and debit cards from nine Chinese banks and is available on its top-end Galaxy smartphones, with midrange models to follow.
