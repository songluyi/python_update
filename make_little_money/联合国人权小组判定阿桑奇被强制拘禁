A U.N. human rights working group has ruled that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been "arbitrarily detained" at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, but the group has no authority over British police seeking to arrest him.
联合国一个人权工作小组判定，维基揭秘创办者阿桑奇在厄瓜多尔驻伦敦大使馆被强制拘禁，但该小组无权向寻求逮捕阿桑奇的英国警方发布指示。
The working group announced its findings Friday, some three-and-a-half years after Assange took refuge in the embassy to avoid arrest and extradition to Sweden on rape charges.
这个联合国工作小组星期五宣布了上述判定结果。为避免因强奸指控被逮捕并引渡到瑞典，阿桑奇在厄瓜多尔驻英大使馆避难已长达3年半左右。
British authorities have not yet responded to the ruling.
英国当局还没有对联合国工作小组的这一判定做出反应。
On Thursday, Swedish prosecutors predicted the U.N. ruling and said Assange's confinement has no impact on the rape case against him in Sweden.
瑞典检察官星期四预料到了联合国工作小组会做出这一判定，并表示，阿桑奇受困不会对他在瑞典被控强奸一案有任何影响。
Assange, who is Australian, published on WikiLeaks a number of leaked diplomatic cables and other sensitive documents the United States considers classified information. It was one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history.
阿桑奇是澳大利亚人，他在维基解密网站上发表了很多泄露的外交密电和美国认为属于机密的其他敏感文件。这是美国历史上最大规模的泄密事件之一。
