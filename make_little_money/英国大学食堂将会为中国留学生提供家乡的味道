Chinese students in the United Kingdom can now get a "taste of home" in their campus canteens.
The 11-day trip in September was organized by The University Caterers Organisation after its research found that menu changes were needed to accommodate campuses' changing demographics. Fourteen TUCO members visited Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong and learned that Chinese food varies by region, and that offering menu choices from both the north and south of China was crucial. At Peking University's Nong Yuan canteen, for example, over 350 different dishes are prepared daily and 47,000 lunches served.
