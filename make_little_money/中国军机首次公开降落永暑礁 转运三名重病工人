A Chinese military aircraft has landed at a new airport on an island China has built in the disputed South China Sea, state media said on last Monday, in the first public report on a move that raises the prospect of China basing warplanes there.
In a front-page story, the official People's Liberation Army Daily said a military aircraft on patrol over the South China Sea on Sunday received an emergency call to land at Fiery Cross Reef to evacuate three seriously ill workers.
