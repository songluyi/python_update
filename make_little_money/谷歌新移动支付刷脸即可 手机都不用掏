Google is rolling out its "Hands Free" payments feature in select restaurants in California's Bay Area which will let people who have the app strut into an eatery, order, and check out simply by saying "I'll pay with Google."
Google isn't the first one to try going down this path, either. Square tried hands free payments way back in 2011, but ended up shutting down the app that offered it. PayPal has a hands-free option too.
