To revive tourism in the disaster-hit Tohoku region, human resources giant Pasona Group Inc. will offer free trips to foreign "stars" on social networking services to help spread the charms of the northeastern region.
Pasona expects the website to receive 10 million monthly views and earn 200 million yen ($1.67 million) annually in three years, mainly through advertisements.
