Chinese Premier Li Keqiang vowed no leniency for anyone involved in the black market sales of problematic vaccines, after a case was made public involving $88 million worth of illegal vaccines that are suspected of being sold in dozens of provincial-level regions around the country.
In response to the case, the World Health Organization (WHO) country office in China on Tuesday released a note that improperly stored or expired vaccines can lose potency and become less effective. The organization also expressed willingness to provide support.
