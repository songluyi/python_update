 Consumer and producer prices are still either muted or in deflationary territory in China – but last month marked something of an uptick for each.
 中国的全国居民消费价格指数(CPI)和工业生产者出厂价格指数(PPI)仍很温和或处于收缩区间，但上月都出现了些许回升迹象。
 Consumer prices rose 2.3 per cent year-on-year, more than expectations of 1.8 per cent. That is the biggest rise since July 2014. They had risen 1.8 per cent in January.
 2月CPI同比上涨2.3%，高于预期的1.8%，为2014年7月以来最大涨幅。1月CPI同比上涨1.8%。
 Meanwhile producer prices fell 4.9 per cent year-on-year in February, as expected, compared to a 5.3 per cent fall in January. The drop was the smallest in eight months.
 另一方面，2月PPI同比下降4.9%，低于1月5.3%的同比降幅。2月PPI降幅为8个月以来最低降幅。
