 Tencent, the Chinese social media and gaming heavyweight, has posted a 21 per cent rise in full-year profit although its net income in the final three months has slightly undershot analysts’ expectations.
 中国社交媒体和网络游戏板块的权重股腾讯(Tencent)宣布去年全年利润增长21%，尽管最后三个月的净利润略低于分析师预期。
 Net income rose by more than a fifth to Rmb28.8bn ($4.44bn) in 2015 as revenue improved by 30 per cent to Rmb102.9bn.
 2015年净利润增长超过五分之一，至288亿元人民币（合44.4亿美元），营收增长30%，至1029亿元人民币。
 Tencent highlighted the continued shift from people using social media and messaging sites on their smartphones rather than desktop or laptop computers, while it also said online shopping is becoming increasingly widespread in China, especially in what it refers to as “lower-tiered cities”, as the spending power of the Chinese middle classes develops.
 腾讯强调了用户的持续转变，即人们更倾向于通过智能手机登录社交媒体和即时通讯网站，而不再是通过台式或手提电脑；腾讯还表示，随着中国中产阶层消费力的提升，网上购物在中国日益普遍，尤其是在三、四线城市。
 Advertising is also increasingly moving from PC to mobile, the internet giant said.
 该互联网巨擘表示，广告也正逐渐从个人电脑向手机转移。
 Fourth quarter earnings, of Rmb7.16bn, were up 22 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier but fell short of analysts forecasts of Rmb7.44bn.
 第四季度的盈利达71.6亿元人民币，同比增长22%，但低于分析师预测的74.4亿元人民币。
 In 2016, Tencent said it would invest further in areas such as group messaging and video format content.
