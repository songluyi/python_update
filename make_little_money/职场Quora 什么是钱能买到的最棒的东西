What is the best thing that money can buy?
钱所能买到的最棒的东西是什么？ 
Time. More specifically, you can generally choose to pay extra to avoid dealing with those aspects of life that you find tedious, boring or offensive.
时间。更具体地说，你可以支付额外费用来避免和生活中你觉得会令你无聊且不快的事物打交道。
This leaves you with more time for those activities that are meaningful, fun and pleasant.
这就让你能把时间更多地花在那些有意义、有意思且令人愉快的事物上。
The most obvious example is that if there's something else you'd rather be doing in the hours you currently work, you could stop doing that. But you can also hire people to take care of other jobs you'd rather live without such as washing and ironing clothes, painting your garage or buying groceries. (of course if you ENJOY any of these activities, you can still do them)
举个最明显的例子吧，当你忙于手头上的工作时，必须放下工作去做其它事情，但是你同样可以去雇个人来帮你解决“其它事情”，比如说洗熨衣服、粉刷车库或者去采购。（当然，如果你喜欢做这些事，你也可以花时间在这上面）
