你的孩子在超市里做过的最尴尬的事是什么？ 
This was in a liquor store rather than a supermarket. I had stopped in for a bottle of wine to give to the hosts of a party. While I was selecting an appropriate bottle, my daughter (who had just turned four) picked up an especially pretty bottle of vodka, covered in little square blue mirrors. Blue is her favorite color. She danced around holding the bottle until I was done making my purchase.
这件事不是发生在超市而是在酒类专卖店。我在去一个聚会的路上顺路进去买瓶红酒给主人家。当我正在挑选一瓶合适的红酒时，我那刚满四岁的女儿拿起了一瓶非常漂亮的蓝色方形小镜片包装着的伏特加，她最喜欢蓝色了，她一直拿着那瓶酒跳舞，直到我买完红酒。
I left the cashier and told her, "It's time to go—you can put that back on the shelf now."
She replied, in a happy, chirpy voice loud enough for the whole store to hear, "But I love vodka!"
她用一种高兴、快活、响亮到整个商店都听得到的声音回答道：“可是我爱伏特加！” 
I'm cheating a bit here because it wasn't my kid and it was in a bank rather than a supermarket, but it's along the lines of the question.
我在这里回答有点不合适，因为那不是发生在我孩子身上，而且也不是发生在超市，而是在银行，不过这个故事和问题主旨是相符的。
About 22 years ago my sister was standing in line at the bank with my beautiful niece who was about 3 or 4 at the time. Little Emily was standing in front of my sister and in front of Emily was a man. All of a sudden Emily announced in that loud way little kids do, "mummy, that man's bottom just burped". My sister was mortified and began attempting to shut her child up, the man immediately left the queue as something terribly important had obviously just come to mind and the bank remained quiet as my niece argued the veracity of her statement. We still laugh about that to this day and prefer bottom burp to fart.
大约22年前，我妹妹和我漂亮的外甥女在银行排队，那时我外甥女大概三、四岁。小艾米丽站在我妹妹前面，艾米丽前面站的是一个男人。突然艾米丽用小孩子独有的大嗓门说道：“妈咪，那个人的屁股刚刚打嗝了。”我妹妹很尴尬，想让她的孩子闭嘴，那个人立刻离开了排队队伍，因为很显然他想到了一些糟糕的事情，而且在我外甥女为她的实话据理力争的时候整个银行都在保持沉默。我们到现在还在笑话这件事，而且一直喜欢用屁股打嗝而不是放屁。
