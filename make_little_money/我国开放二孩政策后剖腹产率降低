Hospitals in China's biggest cities are reporting an increase in women choosing natural childbirth, reversing a decadeslong trend during the one-child policy in which cesarean sections were favored.
The government introduced new exceptions to the one-child policy in late 2013, although they varied from region to region. Since Jan 1, all couples have been allowed to have a second child, and the number of cesarean sections has dropped.
