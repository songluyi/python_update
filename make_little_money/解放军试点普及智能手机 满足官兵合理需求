A brigade in the PLA's 16th Group Army has been allowing mobile phone use and providing Internet access in the military since a July 2015 regulation allowed military personnel to use mobile phones, including smart phones, during extra curriculum time, rest days and holidays "on condition that confidentiality requirements are fulfilled," the PLA Daily reported.
"It's good to see that the PLA has begun adapting to the operational environment in the Internet age, despite various cyber security threats such as information leaks and phone taps," Qin An, director of the China Institute of Cyberspace Strategy, told the Global Times.
