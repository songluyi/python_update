Chinese education authorities announced that they encourage and support eligible universities' recruitment of students with soccer skills to form high-level soccer teams.
"Previously, it was hard for teachers in primary or secondary schools to encourage students to play soccer, as many universities had stopped recruiting students for their soccer skills. This statement paves the way for students to gain admission to their ideal universities through their talent in soccer," Ma Dexing, deputy editor of Changsha-based Titan Sports, told the Global Times.
