Artificial intelligence eventually surpassed humans in the ancient Chinese board game Go as Google's computer program AlphaGo won 3-0 over South Korean Lee Sedol, the world Go champion in the past 10 years, dashing the remaining hopes for reversal in a historic five-game match.
The 33-year-old resigned as the computer program maintained an unassailable lead for more than four hours in the third match that was launched at 1 p.m. local time on Saturday at Four Seasons hotel in Seoul.
