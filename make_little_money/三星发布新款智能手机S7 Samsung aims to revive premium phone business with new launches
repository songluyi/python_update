三星(Samsung)将试图重振其陷于停滞的高端智能手机业务，推出新旗舰系列的Galaxy设备，同时在消费者虚拟现实产品领域为新的未来布局。

周日晚，在巴塞罗那举办的消费电子展——移动通信世界大会(Mobile World Congress)的一个令人瞩目的仪式上，这家韩国电子集团发布了Galaxy S7和S7 Edge智能手机。

按数量计算，三星是世界上最大的智能手机厂商，但过去两年来，来自华为(Huawei)和小米(Xiao)等中国制造商的竞争抑制了三星一度迅猛的增长；中国产品价格更便宜，技术含量也不低。
Both groups are also unveiling new phones at Mobile World Congress, alongside scores of other devices from a wide range of manufacturers, which will highlight the saturation of similar products in a now mature market.
华为和小米也将在移动通信世界大会上发布新手机。总计将有多家厂商发布数十款新设备，突显一个成熟市场上同类产品的饱和度。
