The gap between imports and exports for the first three months of 2016 stands at 13.3bn pounds, up from 12.2bn pounds in the fourth quarter of 2015, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
"A truly horrible first-quarter trade performance that clearly weighed down on GDP growth," said Howard Archer from IHS Global Insight. He added that UK exports had been hampered by moderate global demand as well as sterling's strength in 2015, particularly against the euro.
