Shanghai residents who don't regularly visit their parents may face lawsuits or have their credit score affected under a new local regulation, media reported last Thursday.
Luo Peixin, a deputy director of the Shanghai government legislative affairs office, was quoted by news portal thepaper.cn as saying that aside from influencing people through moral education, the authorities can use legal means to force people to fulfill their duties.
