Chinese search engine giant Baidu announced on Friday that its driverless car has finished road tests and succeeded in automatic driving in mixed road conditions.
Launched in 2013, the company's driverless car project is based on the core "Baidu car brain" technology, which includes high-precision electronic mapping, positioning and decision-making systems.
