The Chinese government has issued new guidelines to protect children in rural areas whose parents have moved to cities to work. An estimated 61 million children are "left behind" by their migrant parents. Many people can only access public services in the villages they come from, so migrant workers' children stay behind to keep up their education.
Millions of migrant workers have moved from the Chinese countryside to cities in recent decades. The World Bank predicts that by 2030, up to 70% of Chinese people will live in cities.
