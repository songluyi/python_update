Dalian Wanda, the Chinese property-to-entertainment company headed by China’s richest man, Wang Jianlin, is to branch out into one of the hottest mainland investment sectors: private hospitals.
中国首富王健林执掌的大连万达(Dalian Wanda)是一家经营房地产、娱乐等多种业务的集团。现在，这家集团又将业务拓展到中国最热门的投资领域之一——私立医院。
Wanda said today it would invest Rmb15bn ($2.3bn) to build three big international hospitals in the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Chengdu and Qingdao.
万达今日表示，将投资150亿元人民币（合23亿美元）在上海、成都、青岛建设三家国际医院。
Wanda said it would be the “largest of its kind in the healthcare sector for a Chinese company” and will be managed by International Hospitals Group, the UK hospitals group. Wanda is also in talks to buy Legendary Entertainment, the Hollywood company behind such films as Godzilla and Pacific Rim.
万达表示，这是中国企业在医疗行业的最大一笔投资，英国国际医院集团(International Hospitals Group)将负责这几家医院的运营。万达还在洽谈收购制作了《哥斯拉》(Godzilla )和《环太平洋》(Pacific Rim)等影片的好莱坞公司传奇娱乐(Legendary Entertainment)。
Beijing has vowed to boost the share of private hospitals in the severely overcrowded hospital sector to 20 per cent by this year. Many private hospitals have opened in recent years, but patients have proved slow to patronise them and healthcare analysts estimate current private hospital share is only about half the targeted figure.
中国政府承诺，今年要将医疗行业中私立医院的比例提高到20%。近年来有多家私立医院开业，但从实际情况来看，患者对它们的接受较为缓慢。医疗行业分析师估计，目前私立医院的比例仅为10%左右。
Wang Jianlin, Chairman of Wanda Group, commented on the partnership. Bringing a top level international hospital brand to the Chinese market is a new innovation in China. It not only satisfies the growing healthcare needs of the country’s affluent population, but also helps the cities in which these projects are located to elevate their healthcare standards to international levels, and to serve as role models for the development of premium healthcare in China.
万达集团董事长王健林针对此次合作表示，引进顶级综合性国际医院是万达在中国的创新，不仅满足高端人群对健康医疗的需求，也使所在城市医疗水平达到国际一流，带动中国高端医疗水平提升。
