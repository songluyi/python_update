Hundreds of people are leaving the last rebel-held section of the central Syrian city of Homs on Wednesday as part of a local peace deal with the government.
星期三，数百人离开叙利亚中部城市霍姆斯反叛武装控制的最后地区，这是与政府达成的一项地方和平协议的一部分。
Syrian forces besieged the area for several years during the country's civil war, as pockets of rebels remained in the area that was one of the early flashpoints in the conflict.
内战期间，该地区多年来一直被叙利亚军队包围，那里是最早爆发冲突的地区之一，被零星反政府武装所占据。
In addition to opposition fighters leaving the Wael district, hundreds of civilians are boarding buses out of the area. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the violence in Syria, said 750 people were expected to leave Wednesday.
除反政府武装人员外，数以百计的平民也登上了离开瓦尔区的巴士。设在英国的监督叙利亚冲突的叙利亚人权瞭望台说，星期三预计会有750人离开那里。
Once the rebel fighters leave, the Syrian government will be in full control of Homs, which is located about 150 kilometers north of the capital, Damascus, along a highway that also connects the cities of Hama and Aleppo further to the north.
反叛武装撤离后，叙利亚政府将全面控制霍姆斯。这里位于首都大马士革以北约150公里处一条高速公路旁，沿公路再往北，还有哈马市和阿勒颇市。
Efforts to bring a comprehensive peace agreement to Syria have so far yielded little progress, while smaller, local deals have been struck in several parts of the country. The United Nations and a group of world powers are currently working to get the Syrian government and various opposition groups to begin U.N.-mediated talks by January 1.
促成叙利亚全面和平协议的努力迄今为止收效甚微，但是有些地区达成了小范围的地方协议。联合国以及一些世界大国正在努力促使叙利亚政府和几个反政府组织在明年1月1日之前开始由联合国斡旋的谈判。
