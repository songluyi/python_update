The amount of central government funds allocated to combat poverty will increase by 43.4 percent year-on-year, the premier said to the ringing applause of national legislators and political advisers at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Saturday.
The central government has pledged to lift all of China out of poverty by 2020. Despite the country's economic prosperity over recent decades, by 2015, there were still 70 million people living below the poverty line of 2,300 yuan ($365) in annual income by 2010 price standards.
