Guo Guangchang, the Chinese businessman who went missing last week while assisting Chinese authorities with an investigation, has been allowed to travel overseas in an apparent sign that he has resumed normal business activities after four days of detention.
中国企业家郭广昌已获准出境旅行，这似乎表明，在经历了四天的拘禁后，他已恢复正常商务活动。郭广昌曾于上周失联，失联期间他在协助中国当局进行一项调查。
Mr Guo, known as China’s Warren Buffett, was seen dining in a restaurant in New York’s Midtown area on Thursday night, while on a business trip expected to include New York and a visit to a performance of Cirque du Soleil in Canada, writes Patti Waldmeir in Shanghai.
周四晚，被称为“中国巴菲特”的郭广昌现身纽约中城一家餐馆用餐。他此行为出差，预计除纽约外，他还将前往加拿大观看太阳马戏团(Cirque du Soleil)的演出。
Fosun, the conglomerate that Mr Guo co-founded, owns a 25 per cent stake in the Canadian entertainment group, as well as owning the French resort group Club Med. Fosun declined to comment.
复星集团(Fosun)拥有太阳马戏团25%的股份，还是法国度假村集团“地中海俱乐部”(Club Med)的东家。对于联合创始人郭广昌现身纽约一事，复星拒绝置评。
Mr Guo is the most high profile private sector businessman to have been ensnared so far in the Chinese government’s anti-corruption and anti-graft campaign. He went missing last Thursday and reappeared on Monday at an internal company conference, where he was greeted with a standing ovation.
在中国政府掀起的这场反贪腐运动中，郭广昌是迄今受到波及的最知名的民营企业家。他于上周四失联，本周一在公司内部会议上再度现身，当时全场起立欢迎。
Neither he nor the company has commented on what the investigation was about or what branch of the government conducted it, nor even whether Mr Guo was a target or just helping the authorities gather evidence about someone else.
关于此次调查的内容、调查由政府哪个部门主持、乃至郭广昌是调查对象还是只是在协助有关部门收集关于其他人的证据，郭广昌本人和复星都没有置评。
