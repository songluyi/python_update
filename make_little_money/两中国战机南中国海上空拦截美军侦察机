Two Chinese fighter jets carried out an “unsafe” intercept of a US military aircraft that was flying over the South China Sea, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.
美国国防部周三表示，两架中国战斗机对飞越南中国海(South China Sea，中国称南海)上空的美国军机进行了“不安全”拦截。
US defence officials said a US maritime reconnaissance aircraft was flying a “routine patrol” and was in international airspace on Tuesday when it was intercepted by two Chinese tactical fighters.
美国国防部官员表示，周二，一架美国海上侦察机在国际领空内“例行巡逻”时，遭到两架中国战术战斗机的拦截。
“Initial reports characterised the incident as unsafe,” a Pentagon statement said.
美国国防部一份声明称：“最初的报告将此次事件定性为不安全。”
The incident comes at a time of increased tensions in the South China Sea ahead of a trip to the region next week by US President Barack Obama when he will visit Vietnam, which is becoming a closer American partner, and Japan.
此际，南中国海紧张关系升级，美国总统巴拉克•奥巴马(Barack Obama)下周将访问亚洲，届时他将访问越南以及日本。越南正成为美国更亲密的合作伙伴。
It also comes weeks ahead of an expected ruling by an international court that could question some of the expansive territorial claims that China has made in the South China Sea.
几周之后，预计一所国际法庭将作出一项裁决，可能会质疑中国对广袤的南中国海部分海域提出的主权声索。
The US says it is neutral on specific Chinese claims in the South China Sea but is using an increased presence in the area to push back against efforts by China to claim control of the seas surrounding many of the small islands and land features.
美国表示，美国对中国在南中国海的特别主权声索保持中立，但目前美国正加大在该地区的影响力，以击退中国对环绕很多小岛和“地物”(land features)的海域声索主权的努力。
The Pentagon said it was addressing the latest incident through diplomatic and military channels. It also said that over the past year, after the US and China signed an agreement about how to deal with air-to-air encounters, there had been “improvements” in the professionalism of Chinese pilots.
美国国防部表示，正通过外交和军事渠道解决最新事件。美国国防部还表示，过去一年，在美国与中国就如何解决空对空相遇行为签署协议后，中国飞行员的专业性有所“提高”。
