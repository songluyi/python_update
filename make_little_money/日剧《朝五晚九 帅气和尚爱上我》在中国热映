Falling in love with a monk seems absurd since monks are often associated with ascetics in Chinese culture. But the TV show From Five to Nine: The Handsome Monk Who Fell in Love With Me is based on that exact premise. And it has won hearts and minds of Chinese audiences.
The storyline is based on a Japanese manga of the same title. Thanks to their ready-made fan base, manga stories have been the dominant source material for Japanese dramas, according to Yuki Furukawa, who plays the heroine's other pursuer in From Five to Nine.
