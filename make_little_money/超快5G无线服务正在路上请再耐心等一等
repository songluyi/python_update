It looks like 5G is here! At least that's what it looked like if you wandered around Mobile World Congress 2016 this week. Booths filled with information about the next-generation wireless standard — some even offering "demonstrations" of the technology — seemed to occupy more floor space even than new smartphones.
The idea of 5G needed no inventing, per se: We've all known for a while that "5" would come after "4." But what the Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) Alliance did shortly after last year's MWC was release something called the "5G White Paper" to lay out what 5G wireless will look like in terms of speed. (Assuming, of course, that consumer companies and hardware vendors can cooperate.)
