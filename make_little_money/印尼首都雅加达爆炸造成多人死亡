Jakarta was rocked by a series of explosions and gunfire on Thursday that police said had killed at least four people, in what the Indonesian president described as an “act of terror”.
周四，雅加达被一连串的爆炸和枪声所震动。警方表示，至少有4人在印尼总统所称的这次“恐怖行为”中丧生。
Unconfirmed reports estimate that as many as seven explosions hit the Indonesian capital, with police involved in a shootout with suspects in downtown Jakarta.
未经证实的报估计，印尼首都发生了多达7起爆炸事件，警方曾在市区与嫌疑分子交火。
President Joko Widodo told local TV: “We condemn acts that spread terror and disturbing peace. We shouldn’t be afraid, we shouldn’t be defeated by this act of terror.”
印尼总统佐科维多多(Joko Widodo)在本国电视台上表示：“我们谴责那些传播恐怖和破坏和平的行为。我们不应感到害怕，我们不应被这类恐怖主义行为击败。”
The first bombing was reported outside the popular Sarinah shopping mall in central Jakarta along Thamrin Street, the capital’s main artery lined with the offices of multinational businesses and top-end hotels, a stone’s throw from the French embassy. The Istana Negara presidential palace is about 2kms away.

Eyewitness said the explosion was followed by gunfire near a Starbucks coffee shop near the shopping centre.

“警方仍在努力确保该地区的安全，88特别分队(Detachment 88)和警员正在搜查大楼，”警方发言人Anton Charliyan对印尼美都电视台(Metro TV)表示。
Mr Charliyan added that five or six attackers are thought to be behind the attack and the search was on for the suspects.

Other unconfirmed reports of attacks elsewhere in the city included an explosion at the busy area of Kuningan.
