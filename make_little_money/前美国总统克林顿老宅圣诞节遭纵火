Arson is suspected in a blaze that damaged the birthplace of Bill Clinton early Christmas morning. The fire at the William J. Clinton Birthplace, in Hope, Arkansas, broke out around 3:20 a.m. Friday.
"There's just evidence and signs that we do believe it was intentionally set," said Hope Fire Department Chief Dale Glanton. "It will be investigated and handled as a potential arson fire." When firefighters first arrived, Glanton says the back wall on the east side of the home was on fire, spreading up through the walls and up to the second floor of the house. They were able to douse the flames in a matter of minutes.
