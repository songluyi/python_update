The United States and China have reached an agreement on a new U.N. Security Council draft resolution aimed at punishing North Korea, a Security Council diplomat told CNN on Wednesday. The resolution is going to be described as the toughest yet on Pyongyang.
In January, Pyongyang claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in its fourth nuclear test.
