The Chinese government will provide free adult education for 1.5 million migrant workers in the next five years to improve literacy and work skills, the Ministry of Education said last Thursday.
Government statistics show China had 277 million migrant laborers as of the end of 2015, while only about 23.8 percent of them had received a high school or higher education and 7.3 percent had received a community college or university education.
