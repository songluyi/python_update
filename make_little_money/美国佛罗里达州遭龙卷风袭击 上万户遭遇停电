Severe weather is blamed for two deaths and five injuries in Manatee County, Florida, local officials said.
"Most of the damage is in Duette, which is in the far eastern border of Manatee County," Azzara told CNN. "That is believed to be where the tornado touched down and lifted a trailer. That's where the family was where the fatalities are."
