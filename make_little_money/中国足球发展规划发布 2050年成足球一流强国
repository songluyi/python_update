Chinese soccer is expected to edge its way into the world leading teams by 2050, according to a plan released by China's National Development and Reform Commission on Monday.
In the second phase which is between 2021 and 2030, China hopes soccer already grows into a sport with firm foundations and becomes "an important engine of the sports industry" while the national men's team stand out in Asia and women's team return to the leading powers in the world.
