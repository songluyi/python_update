Three Indian officials were arrested last Monday for leaking a chemistry exam paper to students, which forced the test to be cancelled for the second time for the same reason.
"We have arrested three persons over the leaking of question papers. We are probing the role of many more," Sonia Narang, head of the criminal investigation department told AFP.
