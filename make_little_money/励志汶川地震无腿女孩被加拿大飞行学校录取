A girl whose legs had to be amputated after she suffered severe injuries in the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, has received an invitation from a Canadian college to experience flying courses during the upcoming winter vacation.
Coming from a small town, Huang could not speak or write English. But the ambitious girl found every possible way to make it up by herself, and scored 98 points in the final exam, up from 66 points in the midterm.
