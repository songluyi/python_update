 Russian president Vladimir Putin has ordered his armed forces to start pulling out of Syria today after a six-month campaign, saying they had largely met their objectives and it was time to focus on peace talks.
 俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔•普京(Vladimir Putin)昨日下令在叙利亚展开军事行动已有6个月的俄军开始撤离叙利亚，称他们已基本上实现战役目标，是时候专注和平谈判了。
 The announcement comes as external powers seek common ground for turning a tentative cessation of hostilities in the civil war into a political solution, efforts that have long been hampered by Moscow’s support for Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad.
 普京宣布撤军之际，外部大国正寻求共同点——将内战中的暂时休战协议转化成一项政治解决方案，但这方面的努力一直受到莫斯科方面支持叙利亚总统巴沙尔•阿萨德(Bashar al-Assad)的掣肘。
 Russia’s military intervention, which began in September, changed the course of the Syrian conflict; before the Kremlin sent in its bombers, Mr Assad’s forces were losing ground to various armed rebel groups.
 俄罗斯于去年9月开始的军事干预，改变了叙利亚内战的走向；在克里姆林宫向叙利亚派出轰炸机之前，阿萨德的军队在与形形色色的武装反叛组织的较量中节节败退。
 Russian air power was often deployed indiscriminately, according to Syrian activists, and in the early stages did not target positions of Isis despite Moscow saying its mission was to destroy the jihadi group.
 叙利亚活动人士表示，俄空军经常不加区别地进行轰炸，而且在早期并没有以“伊斯兰国”(ISIS)的据点为目标——尽管莫斯科方面称自己的任务是摧毁该圣战组织。
 Speaking at a meeting with Sergei Shoigu, minister of defence, and Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, Mr Putin said his objectives had “overall been fulfilled”. The Kremlin said the Russian military would retain a presence in Syria for air force flights to continue to monitor the ceasefire and ensure its implementation.
 普京在与俄国防部长谢尔盖•绍伊古(Sergei Shoigu)及外长谢尔盖•拉夫罗夫(Sergei Lavrov)开会时表示，他的目标已“总体实现”。克里姆林宫表示，俄军将在叙利亚保留部分军事力量，继续执行空中任务，以监督停火协议，确保其得到执行。
