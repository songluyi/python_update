Japanese first lady Akie Abe said she has again visited the controversial Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo, posting photos of the site on the same day Japan and South Korea struck a landmark agreement on wartime sex slaves.
Abe, known as a fan of South Korean culture, did not reveal exactly when she visited the shrine. The top-selling Yomiuri Shimbun cited a shrine official as saying it could not confirm whether she had entered the main shrine.
