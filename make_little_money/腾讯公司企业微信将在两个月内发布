WeChat, which connects more than half a billion individual users via the mobile messaging service, is launching a separate application for enterprise clients. The app, named Qiye Weixin or Enterprise WeChat in English, is under beta testing and is expected to be rolled out in the next couple of months.
It's Tencent's latest move to tap into China's trillion-yuan enterprise software service market, analysts said.
