 Official figures released by China’s finance ministry show that the country’s property slump dealt a serious blow to state revenue from land transfers in 2015, a key source of funding for already cash-strapped local governments.
 中国财政部发布的官方数据显示，楼市低迷使土地转让交易所带来的财政收入在2015年受到沉重打击——对已经财务吃紧的地方政府来说，土地转让交易是关键资金来源之一。
 For years China’s often debt-saddled localities have relied on requisitioning and selling land under their purview for profit or to make up for budget shortfalls, encouraging overbuilding. But figures released this week by the Ministry of Finance show that revenue from such land transfers plummeted 21.6 per cent last year to RMB3.365 trillion.
 多年来，常常债务缠身的中国地方政府一直依靠征用和出让其管辖范围内的土地来获取利润和弥补预算缺口，助长了房地产过度开发。但财政部本周公布的数据显示，来自这类土地交易的财政收入去年锐减21.6%，至3.365万亿元人民币。
 Land allocated for real estate likewise dropped 20.9 per cent from the previous year to 119,800 hectares. That fall is proportionally smaller than the 25.5 per cent drop seen in 2014, but that year’s total annual revenue from transfers actually rose 3.1 per cent, suggesting most local government coffers were under substantially more duress last year.
 房地产建设用地同比也下跌了20.9%，至11.98万公顷。这一跌幅小于2014年25.5%的跌幅，但那年来自土地交易的财政收入总计增长了3.1%，这似乎表明，去年大多数地方政府财库面临着大得多的财务压力。
 The finance ministry attributed the fall in revenue to causes including insufficient market demand and gradual slowdown in the growth of land prices. It credited a fourth-quarter 9.5 per cent rise in annualized revenue to supportive government policies, among other factors, but that growth fell far short of making up for the first three quarters’ drops of between 26 and 38 per cent.
 财政部将财政收入减少归因于市场需求不足和土地价格上涨逐渐放缓。该部还将第四季度财政收入年化增长9.5%归功于政府政策支持等因素，但这一增长远远不能弥补前三个季度介于26%至38%的下滑。
 Few local governments were immune from the drop: the ministry listed Shenzhen, Tibet, the city of Xiamen and Gansu as the only administrative regions that saw year-on-year growth in revenue from land transfers. Far at the other end of the spectrum, the northeastern port city of Dalian saw the biggest annualized drop, with revenue plummeting 56.4 per cent from 2014.
 没几个地方政府免受财政收入下降的影响：财政部名单上仅有深圳、西藏、厦门和甘肃这几个行政区域来自土地交易的财政收入同比有所增长。在另一端，东北港口城市大连的财政收入年度跌幅最大，相比2014年暴跌了56.4%。
