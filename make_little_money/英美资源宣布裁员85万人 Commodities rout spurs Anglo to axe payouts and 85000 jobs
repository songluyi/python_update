The worst slump in commodity markets for a decade engulfed the mining sector yesterday after Anglo American, one of the industry’s most venerable names, shelved its dividend and said it would cut two-thirds of its workforce.
大宗商品市场10年来最糟糕的低迷昨日笼罩采矿业。业内最老牌的公司之一英美资源集团(Anglo American)暂停派发股息，并宣布将裁掉三分之二员工。
The moves are part of a radical restructuring that will see the company retreat from all lossmaking assets, close mines and shed some 85,000 jobs.
这些举动是一项大刀阔斧重组的一部分，它们意味着该公司将放弃所有亏损的资产，关闭采矿场并裁员约8.5万人。
Anglo shares dropped more than 12 per cent to a record low on the news. Other mining and natural resources stocks also fell as oil dipped below $40 a barrel for the first time since the financial crisis and iron ore, the biggest mined commodity, hit a 10-year low.
消息公布后，该集团的股价下跌逾12%，至纪录低点。采矿业和自然资源板块的其它股票也纷纷下跌，油价自金融危机爆发以来首次跌破40美元/桶，而全球开采量最大的矿产——铁矿石价格跌至10年低点。
The moves by Anglo underscore the challenges facing the mining sector as it scrambles to deal with a slowdown in China and a glut in global supplies of everything from copper and platinum to coal and diamonds.
英美资源此举凸显了采矿业面临的挑战。目前该行业正艰难应对中国经济增长放缓，以及从铜、铂到煤炭、钻石等各种大宗商品全球供应过剩的局面。
During the boom years of the commodities supercycle, miners invested hundred of billions of dollars in projects as a rapidly growing China sucked in ever increasing amounts of raw materials. But with commodity prices at multiyear lows they are being forced to slash spending and restructure their businesses to conserve cash and cut costs.
在大宗商品超级周期的繁荣期，快速增长的中国进口越来越多的原材料，矿商在项目上投资了上千亿美元。但是随着大宗商品价格跌至数年低点，它们正被迫削减支出并重组业务，以求节省资金、降低成本。
