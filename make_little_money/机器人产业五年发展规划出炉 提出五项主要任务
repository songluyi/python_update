Robots are not only for fun and games, it's also a very serious industry in China.
China plans to triple its annual production of robots used in the manufacturing sector to 100,000 in five years, according to the plan. China is also aiming to sell more than RMB30b worth of service robots by 2020 amid surging demand in the healthcare, education and entertainment sectors.
