Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, registered the country's worst air quality in the first quarter of 2016, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said last Monday.
Other cities on the worst 10 list include Shijiazhuang, Hengshui, Handan and Tangshan, all in Hebei province, and Jinan and Xi'an, capitals of Shandong and Shaanxi provinces, respectively.
