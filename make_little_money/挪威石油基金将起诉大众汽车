The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund is planning to sue Volkswagen in a rare legal action from Norway’s $850bn oil fund that underscores investor anger over the emissions scandal at the German carmaker. 
全球最大的主权财富基金“挪威石油基金”打算起诉德国汽车制造商大众汽车(Volkswagen)。这家拥有8500亿美元资产的基金采取这一罕见的法律行动，突显出投资者对大众汽车尾气造假丑闻的愤怒。
The oil fund, the carmaker’s fourth-largest shareholder, told the Financial Times that it would take legal action against VW in German courts by seeking to join one of the class-action suits being prepared there. 
挪威石油基金是大众汽车第四大股东。该基金告诉英国《金融时报》，它将在德国的法庭对大众汽车采取法律行动，办法是寻求加入人们在德国准备对大众汽车发起的一项集体诉讼。
“We have been advised by our lawyers that the company’s conduct gives rise to legal claims under German law. As an investor it is our responsibility to safeguard the fund’s holding in Volkswagen,” said Petter Johnsen, chief investment officer for equity strategies at Norges Bank Investment Management, the manager of the oil fund. 
该石油基金由挪威央行投资管理公司(Norges Bank Investment Management)管理。该公司负责股票策略的首席投资官彼得•约翰森(Petter Johnsen)表示：“我们的律师告诉我们，依据德国的法律，该公司的行为导致了法律索偿。作为投资者，我们有责任保护该基金在大众汽车的持股。”
The lawsuit, expected to be filed in the coming weeks, underlines the continuing legal difficulties that VW is facing. With a 1.64 per cent stake in VW’s ordinary voting shares, according to Bloomberg data, the Norwegian fund is the biggest investor not to hold a seat on the carmaker’s supervisory board. Its holding was worth $750m at the end of last year.
