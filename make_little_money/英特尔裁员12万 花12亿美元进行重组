US tech giant Intel is shedding 12,000 jobs as it seeks to cut reliance on the declining personal computer market. The maker of computer chips will take a $1.2bn charge to cover restructuring costs.
The company also said on last Tuesday chief financial officer Stacy Smith would move to a new role leading sales, manufacturing and operations. And Intel would begin a formal search process for a successor.
