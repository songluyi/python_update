Italian local unions sent a letter to the culture minister complaining that the new chief of the Royal Palace of Caserta works late into the evening without notifying other employees.
Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi defended him and said the accusation was ridiculous, "with Felicori at the helm, visitor numbers in February 2016 were up 70% from a year earlier, while takings were up 105%," he added. "The director is simply doing his job. And we all stand by him, without fear."
