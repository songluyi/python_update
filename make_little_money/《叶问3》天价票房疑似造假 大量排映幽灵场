Ip Man 3, the third installment of the hit kung fu franchise based on the life of a martial arts master, has enjoyed massive success on its opening weekend in China. According to estimates from the Beijing-based box office monitor Ent Group, the fight flick grossed 443 million yuan in just three days.
Ticket sales for Ip Man 3 surpassed 300 million yuan on March 5, the second day since its opening. This is a mind-blowing figure in March, when box office performances tend to be weak. Internet users began to speculate on the authenticity of box office earnings, with renowned Sina Weibo user dianyingpiaofang, calling to "stop films from paying the price of these actions."
