China's Ministry of Transport is reportedly mulling over proposals to regulate increasingly popular online cab hailing services, according to Economic Information Daily on last Wednesday.
The new regulations could come as early as the beginning of May, industry insiders said. The new regulations would require cars to be registered on accredited platforms, and only vehicles with transportation permits will be able to sign up.
