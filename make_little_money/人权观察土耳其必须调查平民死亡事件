Human Rights Watch said Tuesday that Turkey needs to control its security forces and investigate the deaths of civilians who were killed during police operations and clashes with armed groups in recent months.
人权观察星期二说，土耳其必须对本国安全部队加以控制，并对近几个月来警方行动以及警方跟武装组织发生冲突所造成的平民死亡事件展开调查。
The group said it documented 15 such deaths in a limited investigation and that local groups report more than 100 deaths since July.
人权观察说，他们在一次范围有限的调查中记录到了15起这类死亡事件，而当地有组织报告说，自7月来已有100多名平民死亡。
Turkish forces launched a new offensive in July against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in southeastern Turkey, a move that ended a cease-fire of more than two years. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan further pledged in November to continue until every one of the militants was defeated.
今年7月，土耳其军队在东南部地区对非法组织库尔德工人党发动新攻势，致使持续两年多的停火宣告结束。土耳其总统埃尔多安11月誓言继续进攻，直至打败库尔德工人党的所有激进分子。
Human Rights Watch said the state had put neighborhoods under curfew and cut off people's access to water, electricity and food.
人权观察说，土耳其当局在当地实行宵禁，并断绝水电和食品供应。
Turkey, the United States and European Union all consider the PKK to be a terror group. The conflict between Turkey and the PKK has left 40,000 people dead since 1984.
土耳其、美国和欧盟都把库尔德工人党视为恐怖组织。自1984年以来，土耳其当局与库尔德工人党之间的冲突已造成4万人死亡。
