Sweden says it preparing to deport about 80,000 asylum seekers who entered the country in record waves last year.
瑞典说，准备将去年潮水般涌入瑞典的难民里的大约八万人递解出境。
The numbers represent half of the 163,000 people who crossed into Sweden escaping wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Interior Minister Anders Ygeman told a Swedish newspaper Thursday the refugees will be expelled because the applications for asylum were being rejected. The rejected applicants will be able to leave voluntarily, or forcibly sent back home.
这个数字占为逃离叙利亚、伊拉克和阿富汗战争而进入瑞典的16万3千人的一半。瑞典内政部长安德斯·耶格曼星期四告诉一家瑞典报纸说，庇护申请被拒绝后，这些人将被递解出境。申请被拒者可自愿离境，否则将被强制遣送出境。
Sweden was a top destination for refugees because of its long-standing open borders policy. But the sheer numbers of refugees have forced Stockholm to impose border controls and identification checks on new arrivals.
瑞典长期实行边境开放政策，因而成为难民首选目的地之一。但是数量庞大的难民潮迫使瑞典重新实行边界控制，并对新来的人进行身份检查。
