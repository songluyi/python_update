The U.S. military said Sunday one of its drones in Iraq has killed an Islamic State fighter it believes was responsible for a missile attack last month that killed a U.S. Marine.
美国军方星期天表示，在伊拉克实施的一次无人机空袭，打死了一名据信对上个月一次火箭袭击事件负责的伊斯兰国战斗人员。那次袭击事件造成一名美国海军陆战队队员丧生。
A spokesman for the U.S.-led operations against the militants, Colonel Steve Warren, said the drone attack killed Jasim Khadijah, described as a former Iraqi officer and "a rocket expert," and five other Islamic State fighters.
美国领导的打击伊斯兰国激进分子军事行动的发言人沃伦上校表示，无人机袭击击毙了贾西姆·哈迪贾，以及其他5名伊斯兰国战斗人员。哈迪贾据称是一名前伊拉克官员和火箭专家。
Warren said Khadijah had controlled the Islamic State rocket attack that killed Staff Sergeant Louis Cardin and wounded eight other Marines at an artillery position in the Makhmur area of northern Iraq.
沃伦上校表示，对伊拉克北部马克穆尔地区一处美军炮兵阵地发动的火箭袭击，是由哈迪贾操作实施的。那次袭击导致路易斯·卡丁上士丧生，另外8名海军陆战队员受伤。
Cardin was the second U.S. combat death since the start of a U.S. campaign to fight Islamic State in Iraq in 2014.
卡丁上士是美国打击伊斯兰国的军事行动2014年开始以来，第二名阵亡的美国军人。
