China's major real estate developer Wanda Group has rejected the authenticity of a media report about its chairman Wang Jianlin's alleged comments about the Madrid government.
Rumors broke out two weeks ago that the Wanda Group was cancelling the multi-million-euro project and sacking its employees in Madrid because Madrid authorities had denied the company the rights to dismantle the facade of the Edificio Espana in central Madrid.
