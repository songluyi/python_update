North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is suggesting his regime has developed a hydrogen bomb.
朝鲜领导人金正恩暗示，朝鲜已经研制出一枚氢弹。
Kim was quoted Thursday by the official KCNA news agency saying North Korea is now "a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self-reliant A (atomic)-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty." KCNA says Kim made the comments while touring the Phyongchon Revolutionary Site.
朝鲜官方媒体朝中社星期四援引金正恩的话说，朝鲜现在“是一个拥有核武器的强大国家，随时准备使用自行研制的原子弹和氢弹来切实捍卫国家主权”。朝中社说，金正恩是视察平川革命历史遗迹时做出这一表示的。
A hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear bomb, is far more powerful than a atomic bomb because of the advanced technology involved.
氢弹又称热核弹，制造氢弹需要更尖端的技术，而氢弹的威力也远远超过原子弹。
South Korea's Yonhap news agency says it was told by an official with the country's intelligence agency that there is no evidence to support Kim's claims.
韩联社说，韩国情报机构的一名官员表示，目前还没有证据支持金正恩的这一说法。
North Korea is under strict economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council for conducting three underground nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.
朝鲜曾于2006年、2009年和2013年进行三次地下核试验，联合国安理会因此对平壤实施了严厉的经济制裁。
