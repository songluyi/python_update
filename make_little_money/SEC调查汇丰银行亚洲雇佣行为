HSBC is being investigated by US regulators over its hiring practices relating to candidates with ties to government officials in Asia. The British-headquartered bank said that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating it, as well as other institutions, “in relation to hiring practices of candidates referred by or related to government officials or employees of state-owned enterprises in Asia Pacific.”
美国监管机构正就汇丰银行(HSBC)在亚洲的一些招聘行为进行调查，这些行为涉及雇佣由政府官员或国企员工介绍，或与之有关系的候选人。这家总部位于英国的银行表示正接受美国证券交易委员会(Securities Exchange Commission)的调查，“涉及到在亚太地区雇佣由政府官员或国企员工介绍或与之有关系的候选人。”同时接受调查的还有其他机构。
In 2013 the hiring practices of JP Morgan came under similar scrutiny, in relation to hiring individuals close to of senior Chinese officials. Bankers say the practice can often help win regulatory approval, as well as coveted big-ticket deals from the government and state-owned enterprises.
2013年摩根大通(JP Morgan)的雇佣行为曾接受过类似审查，审查涉及雇佣与中国政府高官关系亲近的人员。银行家们表示这种做法往往有助于赢得监管部门批准，还能赢得来自政府及国有企业的大宗交易。
From the HSBC statement:The US Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘SEC’) is investigating multiple financial institutions, including HSBC, in relation to hiring practices of candidates referred by or related to government officials or employees of state-owned enterprises in Asia Pacific. HSBC has received various requests for information and is cooperating with the SEC’s investigation.
Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of this matter, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.
基于目前已知事实，汇丰银行此时还无法预测这一问题的最终解决情况，包括解决时间，或可能对汇丰银行造成的任何影响，这些影响可能是显著的。
