A Saudi newspaper reported Sunday that authorities there have arrested nine American citizens and 24 people as terror suspects during the past week.
一家沙特报纸星期日报道说，沙特当局在过去一周时间里逮捕了被怀疑是恐怖嫌疑人的9名美国公民和其他24人。
The arrests also included 14 Saudis, three Yemenis, two Syrians, an Indonesian, a Filipino, an Emirati, a Kazakhstan national and a Palestinian, the Saudi Gazette said.
《沙特公报》说，被逮捕的人中还包括14名沙特人、3名也门人、2名叙利亚人、1名印尼人、1名菲律宾人、1名阿联酋人、1名哈萨克斯坦公民和1名巴勒斯坦人。
But Reuters, citing comments from six U.S. officials, said the United States could not confirm any Americans were among the group and that authorities were still checking names against databases.
但路透社援引6名美国官员的话说，美国方面不能证实有美国公民被逮捕，并表示目前正在数据库中核查有关姓名。
The Saudi Gazette did not say if any of what it called the "terror suspects" were linked to the Islamic State group, which has claimed several deadly attacks against security forces and Shi'ites in the kingdom in recent months.
《沙特公报》的报道没有说明这些恐怖嫌疑人当中是否有任何人和伊斯兰国组织有关联。伊斯兰国组织声称对近几个月来沙特安全部队和什叶派人士发动的数起致命袭击负责。
