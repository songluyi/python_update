As China's one-child policy comes to an end after the National People's Congress wrote into law that all couples are allowed to have two children, the family-planning commission is facing a shift in their work.
The family planning commission in Danfeng township, in Shangluo county, Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, established a "babies' early development center" last November to provide services to newborns from 0 to 3 years old. It's part of a program initiated by the National Health and Family Planning Commission to improve parenting quality in rural areas.
