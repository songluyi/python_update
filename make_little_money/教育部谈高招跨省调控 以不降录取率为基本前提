The Ministry of Education said its efforts to ensure more children from poor backgrounds get a college education will not hurt the chances of students from more affluent parts of China.
Universities and colleges in some more developed provinces with rich tertiary education resources, such as Jiangsu and Hubei, will this year have to take a larger number of students from less developed regions, such as Tibet and Xinjiang, who have passed the gaokao. For instance, universities in Hubei will enroll 40,000 students from less developed regions this year. Jiangsu will take 38,000.
