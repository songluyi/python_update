Higher education data expert QS has launched its first employability rankings that measures which universities are best for graduate job opportunities. The list is compiled using data gathered on institutions' reputations among employers, their partnerships with industry, and graduate outcomes, among other factors.
The UK is represented within the top 10 by the University of Cambridge (4th) and University of Oxford (6th), while the highest-placed entrant from outside of the US or UK is China's Tsinghua University (9th).
