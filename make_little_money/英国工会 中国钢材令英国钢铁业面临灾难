Union leaders have warned the government that Britain’s steel industry faces “catastrophe” unless ministers block Chinese attempts to achieve “market economy status” at the WTO later this year.
英国工会领导人警告政府，如果政府官员们不能阻止中国在今年晚些时候获得世界贸易组织(WTO)“市场经济地位”，英国钢铁业将面临“灾难”。
The warning came as Britain’s biggest steelmaker said it was cutting more than 1,000 jobs, prompting recriminations that the UK was failing to stand up for the steel industry in the face of a deluge of cheap Chinese imports.
发出这一警告之际，英国最大钢厂宣布将削减1000多个工作岗位，此举引发指责称，面对中国低价倾销的洪流，英国政府未能维护钢铁业的利益。
Tata Steel said 750 positions would go at its Port Talbot plant, the UK’s biggest steelworks by output and workforce, along with 100 jobs at mills in Trostre, Corby and Hartlepool and 200 support roles.
英国以产量和员工队伍计最大的钢厂塔塔钢铁公司(Tata Steel)表示，塔尔博特港钢厂将裁减750个岗位，特罗斯特尔钢厂、科比钢厂和哈特尔浦钢厂将裁掉100个岗位以及200个辅助岗位。
The decision underlines the evisceration of Britain’s steel industry, which during the past year has either shed or outlined plans to cut more than 6,000 jobs from a workforce that was 30,000-strong at the start of 2015.
这一决定突显了英国钢铁业遭到的重挫，2015年初时钢铁业就业总人数为3万人，过去一年该行业已裁减或宣布计划裁减6000多个工作岗位。
It also feeds into a roiling debate over China’s place in the global economy as Beijing pushes for market economy status at the World Trade Organisation.
该决定还为围绕中国在全球经济中的地位的激烈辩论提供了素材，北京正争取在世贸组织获得市场经济地位。
