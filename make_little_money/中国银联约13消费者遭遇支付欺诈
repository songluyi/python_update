About 13 percent of China's mobile payment users suffered from fraud while nearly 90 percent among these couldn't get back the money they lost, according to a report by China Union Pay, the country's biggest bankcard association.
Yuan Xiaohan, general manager of the China Union Pay risk control department, said fraud occurred by cheating social-media accounts, credit card spending and consumer refunds.
