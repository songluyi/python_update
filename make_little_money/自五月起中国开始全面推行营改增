The replacement of business tax by value added tax has been hailed as a concrete step in deepening reform of China's taxation sector.
"Only raw materials and fixed assets were eligible for tax deductions since previous taxation reforms. The deductions are extended to real estate, such as factory buildings and offices, this time. It will further reduce tax burdens on companies," said Robert Li, Tax partner of PWC China.
