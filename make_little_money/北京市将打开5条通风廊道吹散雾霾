Beijing is planning to build a web of ventilation corridors to facilitate air flow and blow away smog and pollutants, municipal authorities said on Saturday. The five primary ventilation corridors are designed to be more than 500 meters in width. Some secondary corridors will be over 80 meters wide, said Wang Fei, deputy head of Beijing's urban planning committee.
In addition to the planned primary and secondary ventilation corridors, other smaller corridors will also be added to the system. Construction in these zones will be strictly controlled, and obstacles along the way will be gradually removed, Wang said.
