Wikipedia recently received a 250,000 dollars grant from the Knight Foundation for the first year of work on the "Knowledge Engine" project. According to the formal agreement between Wikipedia's parent company Wikimedia, and the Knight Foundation â€” the purpose of the project is to build a search engine that can oppose Google.
The document lays out further rationale behind the project, stating the Knowledge Engine project is needed as a way to respond to online trends. In Wikipedia's case, this includes more searchers shifting to mobile, a drop in page views, and information pulled from Wikipedia being displayed directly in Google search results.
