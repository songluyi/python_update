Aeon Bank will introduce ATMs that allow people to access cash using only fingerprints for identification, becoming the first Japanese bank to offer biometric verification without also requiring a card or PIN.
The unit of retailer Aeon will open up fingerprint registration Feb. 15, aiming to have the technology ready to use by late March. The first of the fingerprint-reading machines will be installed at a store in Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward. The company plans to add more around summer and hopes to eventually operate around 5,500 units throughout Japan if all goes well.
