Myanmar has released more than 100 political detainees under an amnesty that was the first official act by Aung San Suu Kyi, a former political prisoner herself and now the most significant figure in the new civilian government.
根据一项特赦令，缅甸释放了100多名政治犯。这是昂山素季采取的第一个官方行动。昂山素季也曾经是一名政治犯，但现在是缅甸新文人政府中最重要的人物。
The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said Saturday that 113 political detainees were released across the country. Human-rights groups estimate that Myanmar has had about 500 "prisoners of conscience" in detention.
缅甸官方报纸《缅甸环球新光报》星期六报道，全缅甸共有113名政治犯获释。人权组织估计，缅甸在押的“良心犯”大约有500人。
Families and friends of the detainees began gathering at prisons after Aung San Suu Kyi announced Thursday that prisoners would be released in conjunction with Buddhist new year celebrations in the coming days. Supporters greeted prisoners who were freed Friday with flowers, cheers and hugs. 
在佛教新年即将到来之前，昂山素季上星期四宣布要释放政治犯。在押政治犯的家人和朋友以及支持者星期五手持鲜花，热情欢呼，迎接良心犯的获释，同他们拥抱。
In the midst of the celebrations, however, a court in the central city of Mandalay convicted two peace activists of association with the Kachin Independence Army, an outlawed guerrilla group in far northern Myanmar.
但是，在庆祝政治犯获释的同时，缅甸中部曼德勒市的一家法院裁定两名与克钦独立军有关的和平活动人士有罪。克钦独立军是缅甸北部边缘地区的一个被取缔的游击队组织。
The two Buddhists—28-year-old Zaw Zaw Latt and 34-year-old Pyint Phyu Latt, members of an interfaith organization—say they were on a charity mission.
28岁的僧侣昭昭拉和34的僧侣威玉拉是一个跨宗教组织的成员。他们说，他们是在做慈善工作。
