U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon onThursday told Austria's lower house of parliament that increasing restrictionson migrants will "negatively impact" Europe's commitments tointernational law.
联合国秘书长潘基文周四在奥地利议会下院（国民议会）发表讲话时说，针对难民不断增加的限制将对欧洲履行国际法的承诺产生“负面影响”。
Ban did not single out Austria in hisspeech to lawmakers in Vienna.
潘基文在讲话中没有直接点名奥地利。
Ban told the legislators that, underinternational and European laws, they have a "moral and legal principalobligation to help those fleeing war, human rights abuses, andpersecution."
潘基文对奥地利议员说，在国际和欧洲的法律中，他们有“道德和法律上的重要义务去帮助那些逃离战乱、践踏人权和施行迫害之地的人”。
His comments came on the same daylegislators in Austria's upper house are scheduled to vote on a measure thatwould allow authorities to stop accepting asylum requests at the border if theydecide it is necessary to protect "internal security."
潘基文发表讲话当天，奥地利议会上院（联邦议会）就一项与接收难民有关的法案进行投票。根据这项法案，奥地利当局如果认定必须确保“国内安全”时，可以停止接受边境地区的庇护请求。
If passed, Austria's new law would alsomandate "temporary asylum" for migrants who have applied for asylumsince November 15. They would be compelled to leave Austria after three years ifVienna rules that their home countries have become safe.
如果法案通过，新法律规定只向去年11月15日以来申请庇护的难民提供“临时庇护”。如果奥地利三年后认定这些难民的祖国已经安全，这些人必须离开奥地利。
It would also become more difficult forrelatives of asylum-seekers to join their family members in Austria.
新法律还会使寻求庇护者的家属来奥地利与家人团聚变得更为困难。
