Smartphones are likely to replace wallets in the near future as about 65 percent of the online payment deals last year were done with mobile devices, a new study said.
According to Alipay, mobile payment is more popular in China's underdeveloped western regions. The Tibet autonomous region leads the country in mobile payment with 83.3 percent of the online payment transactions in the region made with mobile devices in 2015. The region is followed by Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces. The autonomous region and provinces on average processed nearly 80 percent of the online payment deals via mobile devices.
