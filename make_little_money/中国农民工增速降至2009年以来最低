The growth rate of China’s migrant workforce has fallen to levels not seen since the depths of the global financial crisis.
中国农民工总量增速已降至本次金融危机最严重时期以来最低水平。
The total number of migrant workers rose 1.3 per cent in 2015 to 277.8m, the slowest rate since 2009 according to data available from the National Bureau of Statistics.
据中国国家统计局公布的数据，2015年农民工总人数上升1.3%，至2.778亿人。这是2009年以来的最低增速。
In 2014 the number of migrant workers had increased 1.9 per cent of 2014, on par with growth in 2009. But growth in China’s mobile workforce jumped to 5.4 per cent year-on-year in 2010, thanks in part to a major stimulus package that revved up economic activity through infrastructure projects and real estate development – and which has left a fraught legacy of overcapacity as the country attempts to transition toward a more services-oriented economy.
2014年农民工总数增加了1.9%，与2009年增幅相当。但2010年农民工总数同比激增5.4%，部分原因是一项重大刺激计划，该计划通过基础设施项目和房地产开发推动经济活动。但随着中国试图转型成更以服务业为导向的经济，该计划也留下了产能过剩这个令人担忧的遗产。
Now China’s “migrant miracle” – in which cheap, mobile labour subsidized an export-driven manufacturing sector – is drawing to a close.
中国的廉价流动劳动力曾对出口驱动型制造业有利好效应，但如今，这一“农民工奇迹”正接近尾声。
Adding to downward pressure on the growth rate is a demographic downshift: the share of migrant workers above age 30 rose to 67.1 per cent last year, up from 57.6 per cent in 2010, according to the latest figures from the statistics bureau.
同时，人口增速放慢也加大了农民工增速的下行压力。根据中国国家统计局最新数据，30岁以上农民比例去年攀升至67.1%，2010年为57.6%，
