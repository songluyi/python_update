Apple Inc has lost exclusivity on the use of the "iPhone" trademark in China and has to share it with a Beijing-based leather products maker.
In order to obtain the exclusivity on the use of the "iPhone" trademark in China, Apple first took the case to the Chinese trademark authority in 2012, but it failed as the agency claimed Apple couldn't prove the name "iPhone" was a well-known brand prior to Xintong Tiandi's registration in 2007.
