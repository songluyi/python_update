Chinese President Xi Jinping Tuesday announced with his Saudi host that the two countries welcome the progress made in China-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) free trade area negotiation, and agreed to establish the free trade area as early as possible as he started his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia.
Wu Yihong, an expert on the Middle East, told the Global Times that another main focus of Xi's Saudi trip will be upgrading China's and Saudi Arabia's energy cooperation, which is at the center of the two countries' economic ties.
