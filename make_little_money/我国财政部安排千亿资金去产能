China's Ministry of Finance said last Wednesday it has earmarked a special fund of 100 billion yuan (15.33 billion U.S. dollars) to subsidize local governments and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in reducing steel and coal overcapacity.
The remainder will be allocated based on how well local governments and SOEs fulfill their assignments, the statement said.
