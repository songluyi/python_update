The United Nations Security Council hascondemned North Korea for its submarine launched ballistic missile testSaturday, calling it "another serious violation" of existing U.N.resolutions.
联合国安理会谴责朝鲜星期六进行的潜射弹道导弹试验，称此次试射是对现有联合国决议的又一次严重违反。
In a statement issued Sunday, the Councilsaid these missile activities "contribute to the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea's development of nuclear weapons delivery systems,"while increasing global tensions.
联合国安理会在星期天发表的一份声明中说，这些导弹试射行动是“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为了开发其核武器运送系统”，加剧了全球局势紧张。
The statement also warned that the SecurityCouncil will "take further significant measures" against the North,just weeks after imposing tough new sanctions to pressure Pyongyang to complywith existing U.N. mandates.
这份声明还警告说，联合国安理会将对朝鲜采取进一步重大举措。几周前，安理会刚刚对朝鲜实施了新的严厉制裁，对平壤施压，使其遵守现有联合国决议。
Pyongyang's state-run KCNA news agency saidthe latest test, which was personally monitored by leader Kim Jong Un, provedthe reliability of its submerged launching system. However, South Korea called the test afailure, noting that the missile traveled only 30 kilometers before fallinginto the sea. The flight was well short of the minimum 300 kilometer range forthe type of missile tested, and one Seoul government source said the missile’s enginemalfunctioned shortly after it was launched.
朝鲜官媒朝中社宣称，最新一次导弹试射得到了朝鲜领导人金正恩的亲自指导，证明了其水下发射系统的可靠性。不过，韩国方面称朝鲜此次导弹发射失败，说导弹落入海中之前，只在空中飞行了30公里，远远低于这类导弹的300公里的最低射程。首尔当局的另一消息来源表示，此次试射导弹的发动机在发射后不久就出现了故障。
Earlier, U.S. President Barack Obama saidit is "clear that North Korea is actively engaged in provocativebehavior." During a visit toGermany, Obama also dismissed a North Korean offer to impose a moratorium onnuclear tests if the U.S. suspends annual military drills with South Korea.
美国总统奥巴马早些时候表示，朝鲜明显是在积极从事挑衅行为。奥巴马在对德国访问期间，还拒绝了朝鲜有关如果美国中止与韩国的年度军演，朝鲜也将暂停核试验的提议。
