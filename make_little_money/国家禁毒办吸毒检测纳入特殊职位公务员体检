In regions facing severe drug abuse problems, a drug test and a background check against a national database of known drug users will be required before candidates are allowed to assume some special posts in government, according to a notice from the National Narcotics Control Commission (NNCC) of China, the Beijing Times reported.
Officials who use drugs can be expelled from their posts in severe situations, according to a regulation that took effect in 2007. They also face a stricter standard when it comes to conviction for drug-related crimes, Fang Wenjun, a Supreme People's Court judge, was quoted by news outlet people.cn as saying on April 7.
