U.S. media reports say Iran has tested a new medium-range ballistic missile in defiance of two United Nations Security Council resolutions.
美国媒体报道说，伊朗无视联合国安理会两项决议的规定，对一种新型中程弹道导弹进行了试射。
U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told media outlets the test was held November 21, and they say the missile traveled within Iranian territory.
未透露姓名的美国官员对媒体说，这次导弹试射是在11月21日进行的，导弹试射范围在伊朗领土之内。
Fox News cited intelligence sources as saying the test was held near Chabahar, a port city near Iran's border with Pakistan.
福克斯新闻网援引情报机构消息人士的话说，试射导弹的地点位于伊朗与巴基斯坦边界附近港口城市恰赫巴哈尔附近。
In October, Iran tested a long-range ballistic missile, drawing condemnation from the U.N. Security Council. The Council is still debating how to respond to that test.
伊朗今年10月曾试射一枚远程弹道导弹，招致联合国安理会的谴责。目前安理会仍在就如何对那次导弹试射做出反应进行辩论。
Following that earlier missile test, the White House said there were "strong indications" that Tehran "did violate U.N. Security Council resolutions that pertain to Iran's ballistic missile activities." However, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said those violations are "entirely separate" from the historic nuclear deal reached between Iran and world powers.
伊朗10月试射导弹后，白宫曾表示，此举“强烈显示”德黑兰违反了联合国安理会有关伊朗弹道导弹活动的相关决议。但白宫发言人欧内斯特说，伊朗违反安理会决议试射弹道导弹的做法与德黑兰和世界六强国达成的历史性核协议“完全没有关联”。
