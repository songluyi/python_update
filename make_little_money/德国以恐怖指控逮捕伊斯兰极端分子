Germany has arrested one of its most prominent Islamic extremists on charges he supported a foreign terrorist group.
德国以支持国外恐怖组织的指控逮捕了该国最知名的伊斯兰极端主义分子之一。
German prosecutors announced Tuesday that they have arrested 35-year-old Salafist Sven Lau on four counts of aiding the Syria-based group known as Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar, or JAMWA. The group has been linked to Islamic State.
德国检察官星期二宣布，他们以协助在叙利亚的“圣战组织移民和支持者武装”等四项罪名，逮捕了35岁的萨拉非斯特·史文·劳。该组织和伊斯兰国恐怖组织有牵连。
Lau is suspected of recruiting fighters for the group as well as providing financial and material support.
史文·劳涉嫌为该组织招募战士以及提供财政和物质支持。
Lau, a convert to Islam, gained fame last year when he organized a force of so-called "Sharia police" in the German city of Wuppertal. The men wore orange jackets marked "Sharia Police" and patrolled the streets trying to enforce strict adherence to Islamic law, demanding that nightclub patrons stop drinking, gambling, and listening to music.
皈依伊斯兰教的史文·劳因为去年在德国伍珀塔尔市组织了一个名叫“伊斯兰法警察”的队伍而出名。该组织成员身穿印有“伊斯兰法警察”的橘色马甲在街上巡逻，试图严格实施伊斯兰法，并要求光顾夜总会的人停止酗酒、赌博和听音乐。
A Wuppertal court last Thursday decided not to prosecute the men. The ruling has sparked nationwide controversy.
伍珀塔尔市法庭上周四决定不起诉这些人。这一裁决在德国全国引发争议。
