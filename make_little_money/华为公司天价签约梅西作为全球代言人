He Gang, the head of Huawei Technologies smartphone unit, and Liu Tao, the Chinese companys CEO for Latin American consumer business, take selfies with Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi in Barcelona on last Thursday. The company has signed the 28-year-old FC Barcelona striker as its global ambassador.
He Gang, head of Huaweis smartphone unit, said Messis involvement will quickly boost the brand awareness for the company, which is trying to seize a larger share of the smartphone markets outside of China. "We are looking at a long-term partnership with Messi because Huawei and Messi desire victory," he said.
