Arab news outlets say Yemen President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi dismissed his prime minister and vice president, Khaled Bahah, in a major government shakeup ahead of United Nations-brokered peace talks with Iran-backed Houthi militants later this month.
阿拉伯媒体说，也门总统哈迪罢免了总理兼副总统巴哈的职务。在也门政府发生重大人事变动之际，与得到伊朗支持的胡塞激进分子的和谈将于本月晚些时候举行，和谈是在联合国的斡旋下进行的。
Yemen state television, reporting Sunday, said Hadi had replaced Bahah with army General Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar as the government's new vice president. He also appointed lawmaker Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr as prime minister.
也门国家电视台星期日报道说，哈迪任命陆军将领阿马尔接任副总统，并任命议员达赫尔继任总理职务。
The president had offered no public explanations for the moves by early Monday. But Yemeni and other international media have reported simmering differences between Hadi and Bahah over tactics and strategies for ending the country's protracted civil war.
直到星期一凌晨，哈迪一直没有对政府高层变动做出公开解释。但据也门和国际媒体报道，哈迪和巴哈围绕结束旷日持久内战的战术策略存在严重分歧。
Those differences exploded into public view in December when Bahah rejected the president's move to reshuffle the government without first consulting with him.
去年12月 ，巴哈反对哈迪在未同自己磋商之前改组政府，此举使两人的分歧公开化。
Unlike the more hardline Hadi, analysts have described Bahah as favoring a political settlement to the conflict.
分析人士说，哈迪持强硬立场，而巴哈则主张通过政治途径解决国内冲突。
