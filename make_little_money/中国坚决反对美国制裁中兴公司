China urged the United States to stop imposing sanctions against telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp for alleged violation of US export controls on Iran.
It is reported by Reuters that the US Commerce Department is set to place export restrictions on ZTE. The restrictions will make it difficult for the company to acquire US products by requiring ZTE's suppliers to apply for an export license before shipping any American-made equipment or parts to ZTE.
