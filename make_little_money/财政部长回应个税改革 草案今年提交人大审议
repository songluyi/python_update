China has completed a reform plan on individual income tax and it will be submitted to the national legislature for review this year, Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said Monday.
The implementation of the law is complicated and will be promoted step by step, said Lou. The personal income and property information system should also be improved and relevant laws need to be amended for the individual income tax reform, he added.
