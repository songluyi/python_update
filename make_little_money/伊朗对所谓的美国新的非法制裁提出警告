Iran said Thursday it would respond to any "interventionist" measures by the United States, after U.S. officials said the Treasury Department was preparing new sanctions connected to Iran's ballistic missile program.
伊朗星期四说，它将对美国采取的任何“干预性”措施作出回应。之前，美国官员表示，美国财政部正准备针对伊朗弹道导弹计划实施新的制裁。
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossein Jaber Ansari called the planned sanctions "unilateral, arbitrary and illegal."
伊朗外交部发言人阿萨里称计划中的制裁是“单方面的，武断的和非法的。”
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the planned move, said the sanctions will likely be formally announced this week and include about 12 people and companies in Iran, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates.
《华尔街日报》率先报道了这一正在计划中的举措。报道说，制裁措施很可能于本周正式公布，制裁对象包括伊朗、香港和阿联酋的12个个人和企业。
The sanctions would call on U.S. banks to freeze the assets of those on the list and bar individuals and companies in the U.S. from doing business with them, according to the Journal.
《华尔街日报》说，制裁将要求美国的银行冻结制裁名单上的人员及企业的资产，并禁止美国的个人和企业与其做生意。
Iran test-fired missiles in October and November. The U.S. and France said the October launch violated a U.N. Security Council resolution banning Iranian development of a ballistic missile. Iran rejected the allegations, saying the sanctions only applied to missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and that their missiles had no such capability.
伊朗于今年10月和11月进行了导弹试射。美国和法国说，10月的导弹试射违反了联合国安理会有关禁止伊朗研制弹道导弹的决议。伊朗对这一指称予以否认，声称安理会决议只针对能够携带核弹头的导弹，而伊朗试射的导弹并不具备这种能力。
U.S. experts said the only purpose of the missile would be to deliver a nuclear warhead.
美国专家指出，这种导弹的唯一用途就是运载核弹头。
