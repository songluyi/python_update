Rapid wage gains in China that began after the 2009 global financial crisis have begun to fade as the economy slows, and that could create problems for officials trying to boost domestic consumption.
"China's fairly pragmatic policy makers have recognized the limits of things like minimum wage increases," said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. "You cannot expect wage growth to continue if business conditions and profit developments are weaker."
