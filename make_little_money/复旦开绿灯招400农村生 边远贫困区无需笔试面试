Students in remote or impoverished rural regions who are in their final grade in high school will no longer need to make the long journey to Shanghai for written tests and interviews to secure a place in prestigious Fudan University.
Candidates who want to compete for a spot at Fudan through the program need to submit materials online before April 25 including academic ranking, evidence of school performance, strong points in subjects and spirit of innovation and potential. Fudan will release the list of qualifying students in late May. Performance in the gaokao will be key, according to the admission rules.
