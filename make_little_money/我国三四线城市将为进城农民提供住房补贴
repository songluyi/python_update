China may step up efforts to slash its mounting housing inventory, with farmers and migrant workers being the biggest beneficiaries.
The plan includes measures such as financial and mortgage interest subsidies, and tax breaks, according to the newspaper. The ministry is also considering including migrant workers in the housing provident fund, a low-mortgage rate provision program that was until recently designated for urban employees.
