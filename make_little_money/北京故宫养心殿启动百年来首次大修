One of the buildings at Beijing's Palace Museum, or Forbidden City, most closely associated with imperial life is to undergo a major renovation based on traditional construction techniques, the museum announced on Friday.
The project is scheduled to be completed by 2020, just in time to celebrate the Forbidden City's 600th birthday.
