　　Shot from above, it would be hard to guess where these mesmerising pictures were taken.
　　从上空取景，你很难判断出这些让人目瞪口呆的照片是从哪里拍摄的。
　　They do, in fact, show the sprawling suburbia of Wuhan, a city in the planet's most populous country, China.
　　事实上，这些照片展示了中国人口最稠密的城市——武汉——不规则的郊区区域。
　　Wuhan, in the Hubei province of central China, is home to 10million people - many of whom live in these colourful houses away from the high-rise city centre and factories.
　　武汉是中国中部湖北省的一座城市，拥有1000万人口。很多人都住在这些远离市中心和工厂五颜六色的房子里。

　　宽阔干净的街道将这些比邻而居的人分割开来。房屋附近还有一些人工湖。红色的屋顶象征着好运和幸福。
　　There has been a boom in residential construction in Wuhan in recent years; many of these houses were likely built during this time.

　　Wuhan is twinned with Manchester in the UK, but the houses are a far cry from the terraces of the northern centre of industry.
　　武汉和英国的曼彻斯特很相似，但是这些房屋和曼彻斯特这个工业城市的北部中心的联排房屋还是有很大差别。
　　The city has many lakes and rivers running through it, which in recent years have been blighted by serious pollution.
　　武汉有很多条河流和湖泊流经而过，但是因为近几年来的严重污染而枯竭了。
　　The hazy city centre can be seen in the background of this shot, showing that it is in commuting distance for those living there.
　　被雾霾笼罩的城市中心在图的背景中隐约可见，图中也可以看到住在那里的人的通勤距离。
　　The multi-storey houses are all of a similar design and look to be relatively modern.
　　这些多层的房屋的设计都很相像，都比较现代化。
