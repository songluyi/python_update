A team of researchers based at Harvard University say they have developed a testing method that could quickly diagnose Zika virus, and do so basically anywhere in the world.
哈佛大学的一个科研小组说，他们成功研制出了一种快速确诊寨卡病毒感染的方法，而这种方法在世界各地都可以使用。
The Zika outbreak first hit the Western Hemisphere a year. Some 57 countries and territories are now reporting cases of people being infected, most by mosquitos that can carry the Zika virus. Several countries also have reported cases that appear to have spread through sexual contact.
一年前，西半球首先爆发寨卡病毒感染疫情，目前已有57个国家和地区发现寨卡病毒感染病例，其中大多数是被携带寨卡病毒的蚊子叮咬而受到感染，还有几个国家发现了由性接触感染寨卡病毒的病例。
Building on work they did to develop a screening method for Ebola, the researchers led by synthetic biologist James Collins came up with a way to screen blood, urine or saliva for Zika virus.
哈佛科研小组曾研究出诊断埃博拉病毒感染的方法。在合成生物学家科林斯的带领下，该小组以这种方法为基础，找到通过检验血液、尿液或唾液诊断寨卡病毒感染的方法。
In a paper published in the journal Cell, they said their method uses paper cards about the size of a human hand. If Zika is present, the card changes color. The testing can produce a result in as little as 30 minutes with the change in color easily visible to the naked eye. An even faster result can be achieved by placing the card in a special reader, the researchers say.
他们在《细胞》期刊上发表论文说，这种诊断方法使用一张人手大小的试纸，如果接受检测的体液中携带寨卡病毒，试纸会改变颜色，30分钟就可以得出人眼可以观察出的结果。研究人员说，如果使用特别检测仪观察试纸，时间还可以更短。
