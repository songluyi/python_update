China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their adjacent waters, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying reiterated on Modnay.
China has completed the construction of an airport on Yongshu Reef, Hua said on Saturday, adding that "the Chinese government conducted a test flight to the airport with a civil aircraft in order to test whether or not the facilities on it meet the standards for civil aviation. Such activities fall completely within China's sovereignty."
