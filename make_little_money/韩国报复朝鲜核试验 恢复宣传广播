韩国宣布，星期五恢复向朝鲜的高音喇叭宣传广播，以此回应平壤本周早些时候的核试验。
"The broadcasts will begin tomorrow at noon (0300 GMT)," an official at the presidential Blue House said.
韩国总统府青瓦台的一位官员说，“广播从星期五中午开始”。
The two countries, which remain technically at war after the 1950-1953 Korean conflict, traded artillery fire in August over the broadcasts. South Korea stopped the transmissions after it agreed with Pyongyang on a package of measures aimed at easing animosities.
1950-53朝鲜半岛冲突后，韩国和朝鲜实际上仍处于战争状态，去年8月两国因高音喇叭广播争端互射炮火。在与平壤就缓和敌对状态达成一揽子措施协议后，韩国停止了广播。
The North's claim that it tested a hydrogen bomb Wednesday is a "grave violation" of that August agreement, Cho Tae-yong, a senior presidential national security official, said in a statement.
韩国总统国家安全高级官员赵泰永在一份声明中说，朝鲜宣称星期三进行的氢弹试验“严重违反”了8月的协议。
"Our military is at a state of full readiness, and if North Korea wages provocation, there will be firm punishment," Cho said.
