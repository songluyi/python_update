The San Antonio Spurs met the end to their season in Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals Thursday, and questions regarding the futures of veterans Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili began just minutes later.
"Of course, it's been an amazing run," said Ginobili, 38. "We all enjoy playing with each other. I'm so proud of having played with those guys for so many years and winning so many games, and even playing with the new guys. If there's a reason why you always want to come back and keep being part of this, it's because of the amazing chemistry, the good times and the good people that you play with and spend time with. It's not always about winning a game or winning a championship. But you learn from losses, and it's important to enjoy every day. Being a part of this team, I'm very proud of it, even if sometimes it doesn't go our way."
