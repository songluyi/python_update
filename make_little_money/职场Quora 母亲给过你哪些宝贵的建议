你母亲给过你最棒的建议是？
"You don't marry a man, you marry a lifestyle."
“你不是嫁给一个男人，而是嫁给一种生活方式。”
Who you marry has the largest impact not just on your emotional life, but also on your lifestyle.
你所嫁的那个人不仅会对你的感情生活会有很大影响，对你的生活方式也是如此。
Both the large and small things in your daily life and long term plans will be impacted by your significant other's likes, dislikes, habits, schedule, health, personality, moods, job stresses, financial security, family, and situation.
不管是你日常生活中大大小小的事情，还是长期规划，都会受你重要的另一半的影响，包括喜好、憎恶、习惯、计划、健康状况、个性、情绪、工作压力、经济保障、家庭以及处境。
Lucky for me, I married my best friend and someone who fits my lifestyle. Jay Wacker, who loves to travel, cook, watch Game of Thrones, take pictures and who can be silly and serious.
幸运如我，能够和适合我生活方式的好朋友杰伊·瓦克尔结婚，他喜欢旅行、烹饪、看《权力的游戏》和摄影，可逗比，也可严肃。
"You can make any choice you want if you are willing to accept the consequences that come with it."
“你可以做出任何你所想要的选择，只要你愿意接受它所带来的后果。”
When I was a little girl my mother told me that if you want to know whether a person is really nice, observe the way that person treats salesclerks, waiters, and other people in service professions who can't defend themselves. She was 100% correct, and I've never forgotten it.
当我还是小女孩的时候，妈妈就告诉我，如果你想知道一个人是不是真的友善，那就观察一下那个人对待售货员、服务员和其他无法为自己辩护的服务行业人士的方式。她说的完全正确，而且我从未忘记。
It is very useful in sorting people out.
这在辨别他人方面这真的很有用。
Right before I walked down the aisle to marry her son, my mother-in-law told me, "Michelle, if a man can't make himself a sandwich, he should starve."
就在我要步上红毯嫁给她儿子之前，我婆婆对我说：“米歇尔，如果一个男人不会给自己做三明治，那他就活该饿死。”
