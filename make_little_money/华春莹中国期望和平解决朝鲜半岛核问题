All sides should be committed to the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and avoid escalation of tensions, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Friday.
China urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to abide by its commitment to non-nuclearization and desist from all actions that might worsen the situation, Hua stressed.
