4架美国战机星期三飞越韩国领空，再次向朝鲜展示武力。朝鲜最近进行了核试验和弹道导弹试射。

美韩空军联合部队指挥官欧肖内西中将说：“这次飞行使命展示了美韩联盟的力量以及美韩两国维持朝鲜半岛稳定的决心。”
Wednesday's mission took place 10 days after Pyongyang launched a long-range rocket and placed what it called an "Earth observation satellite" into orbit. The launch was condemned by the international community as a violation of United Nations sanctions against the regime for previous long-range ballistic missile tests.
这次行动的10天前，平壤发射了一枚远程火箭，将其所称的一颗“地球观测卫星”送入轨道。国际社会谴责平壤发射火箭违反了联合国针对朝鲜先前进行的远程弹道导弹试射实施的制裁。
