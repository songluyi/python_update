Belgian prosecutors say they have handed over to France terror suspect Salah Abdeslam, who is alleged to be a key player in the November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people.
比利时检察官说，他们已经把恐怖分子嫌疑人阿布德斯兰交给法国。阿布德斯兰是去年11月13日巴黎恐怖袭击的关键嫌疑人，有130人在那次袭击中丧生。
The Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office said in a statement Wednesday that Abdeslam was delivered to French authorities earlier in the day, on a March 19 European arrest warrant.
比利时联邦检察官办公室星期三在一份声明中说，比利时当天稍早已经根据3月19日欧洲颁发的逮捕令，将阿布德斯兰送交法国当局。
Last Thursday, Belgian authorities charged Abdeslam with attempted murder linked to a shootout in the Brussels district of Forest last month. Police were investigating a suspected militant safe house when the gunfight broke out. Four police officers were injured and an Algerian suspect was killed. Investigators found Abdeslam's fingerprints at the scene and he was arrested three days later.
上个星期四，比利时当局以企图谋杀罪对阿布德斯兰提出起诉，此案与上个月在布鲁塞尔福雷区的枪击事件有关。当时，警察在调查一个疑似激进分子藏身处的时候爆发了枪战，四名警官受伤，一名阿尔及利亚嫌疑人被打死。调查人员在现场发现了阿布德斯兰的指纹，三天后将他逮捕。
Abdeslam has told investigators that he arranged logistics for the Paris attacks and had planned to blow himself up at a sports stadium in the city on November 13, but change his mind at the last minute.
阿布德斯兰告诉调查人员说，他曾负责巴黎袭击的后勤保障，11月13日原计划在巴黎一个体育场发动自杀爆炸袭击，最后时刻改变了主意。
Without giving further details, Abdeslam's lawyer has confirmed that his client had admitted being in Paris during the attacks.
阿布德斯兰的律师证实，他的委托人的确承认，巴黎恐怖袭击时他人在巴黎，但是没有提供更多细节。
