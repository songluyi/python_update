After actors and actresses win Oscars, television viewers typically look forward to their acceptance speeches, and this year they will be delivered by some of the more than 200 nominees who will attend the 88th Academy Awards ceremony at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California, Sunday. Discover some fun facts about what performers have said after they were awarded the famous gold-plated statuettes in the past.
美国加州当地时间2月28日，第88届奥斯卡颁奖礼在好莱坞杜比剧院举行。今年的奥斯卡提名者有200多人，最终获奖的那部分人将发表获奖感言，电视观众们通常对这些演讲还挺期待的。在过去历届奥斯卡颁奖礼上，当获奖者手握著名的小金人时，都发生过哪些有趣的故事？本文为您总结了以下真相。
1. The oldest person to give an acceptance speech. Christopher Plummer. At the age of 82, Plummer received the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work in "Beginners" (2010). He starred in the film opposite Ewan McGregor.
发表获奖感言的年龄最大者——克里斯托弗·普卢默。因2010年出演《初学者》，时年82岁的普卢默获得了奥斯卡最佳男配角奖。他在片中与伊万·迈克格雷戈上演对手戏。
2. The youngest person to give an acceptance speech. Tatum O'Neal. The actress took home the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her role in "Paper Moon" (1973). She was just 10 years old.
发表获奖感言的年龄最小者——塔陶·奥尼尔。因1973年出演《纸月亮》，奥尼尔获得奥斯卡最佳女配角奖。当时的她只有10岁。
3. The shortest acceptance speech. Joe Pesci famously uttered five words when he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for "Goodfellas" (1990). But he's not the only celebrity enamored of brevity. Another of few words was Alfred Hitchcock when he was presented with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1968. The same year, Patty Duke simply said, "Thank you," when she won the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for "The Miracle Worker."
最短的获奖感言。因1990年在电影《好家伙》中的出色表现，乔·佩西获得奥斯卡最佳男配角奖，而他发表的获奖感言竟然只有令人惊讶的五个单词。不过他还不是唯一一位言简意赅的获奖名人。另一个吝惜言词的获奖者是阿尔弗雷德·希区柯克——当他1968年获得欧文·托尔伯格纪念奖时。同样是在1968年，蓓蒂·杜克因出演《海伦凯勒》获得奥斯卡最佳女配角奖，她的获奖感言只有两个字：“谢谢。”
4. Liza Minnelli has a special place among the winners. She is the first (and only) star who won an Oscar after both her parents also took home Academy Awards. Minelli won a Best Actress for "Cabaret" (1972); her mother, Judy Garland, received an honorary award in 1939; and her father, Vincente Minnelli, won as Best Director for "Gigi" (1958).
在众多的获奖者中，莱莎·明奈利可以算是很特别的一个。她是首位、也是唯一一位自己和父母都获得过奥斯卡奖的演员。因1972年出演《歌厅》，明奈利摘得奥斯卡影后桂冠。她母亲朱迪·加兰1939年获得奥斯卡终身成就奖。她父亲文森特·明奈利因执导1958年的《金粉世界》获奥斯卡最佳导演。
5. The first person to thank her mother. Greer Garson was honored with the Best Actress Oscar for "Mrs. Miniver" (1942).
第一个在获奖感言中“感谢母亲”的演员——葛丽·嘉逊。嘉逊因出演1942年的《忠勇之家》问鼎奥斯卡影后。
6. The first person to thank his father. Ernest Borgnine was honored with the Best Actor Academy Award for "Marty" (1955).
第一个在获奖感言中“感谢父亲”的演员——欧尼斯·鲍基尼。鲍基尼因出演1955年的《君子好逑》问鼎奥斯卡影帝。
7. Robert De Niro thanked his grandmother and grandfather. He also expressed his gratitude to his mother and father when he accepted the Best Actor Oscar for “Raging Bull” (1980).
在获奖感言中感谢祖父母的演员——罗伯特·德尼罗。他因出演1980年的《愤怒的公牛》，摘得奥斯卡影帝奖项。他在获奖感言中也向自己的父母表达了感谢。
8. Halle Berry arguably gave one of the most memorable acceptance speeches. When Berry became the first black woman honored with the Best Actress Academy Award for "Monster's Ball" (2001), she acknowledged other black women for helping to make her win possible, saying: "This moment is so much bigger than me. This is for every nameless, faceless woman of color who now has a chance tonight because this door has been opened."
哈莉·贝瑞可以说是发表了最令观众难忘的奥斯卡获奖感言。因出演2001年的《死囚之舞》，贝瑞成为历史上首位获得奥斯卡影后的黑人女性。她在获奖感言中向所有黑人女性表达了感谢，认为是大家的共同努力，才使她获奖。她表示：“这一刻对我来说意义非凡。这是所有默默无闻的黑人女性的胜利。因为今晚，这扇门终于向我们敞开了。”
Bonus: Nameplates are created for all potential winners ahead of time, which means more than 200 are made most years.
彩蛋：小金人底座上的获奖者姓名牌都是在提名的时候就提前做好的。这也意味着差不多每年都要制作200多个这种小牌子。
