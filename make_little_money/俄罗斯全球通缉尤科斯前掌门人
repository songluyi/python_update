A Russian court has ordered the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, as the conflict between the Kremlin and the former oil tycoon flares up anew.
俄罗斯一法庭下令逮捕俄罗斯前石油大亨米哈伊尔霍多尔科夫斯基(Mikhail Khodorkovsky)，这表明俄罗斯政府与霍多尔科夫斯基之间的冲突再次爆发。
Once Russia’s richest man and the head of Yukos, the oil group, Mr Khodorkovsky spent 10 years in jail on what were widely seen as politically motivated fraud charges. President Vladimir Putin ordered his release on compassionate grounds two years ago.
霍多尔科夫斯基曾经是俄罗斯首富，掌管石油集团尤科斯(Yukos)，他因被广泛视为出于政治动机的欺诈指控被判10年监禁。两年前俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔渠京(Vladimir Putin)下令给予他特赦。
In recent months Mr Khodorkovsky has become increasingly outspoken in his criticism of Mr Putin, saying at an event in London that a “revolution” was “inevitable” in Russia.
最近几个月，霍多尔科夫斯基在批评普京方面变得越来越直言不讳，他曾在伦敦的一个活动上表示，俄罗斯发生“革命”是“不可避免”的。
Earlier this month, the government’s Investigative Committee — Russia’s top criminal investigative body — accused Mr Khodorkovsky of organising the 1998 murder of Vladimir Petukhov, a mayor in Siberia, and the attempted murder of four other people.
本月早些时候，俄罗斯最高刑事调查机构——俄罗斯政府调查委员会(Investigative Committee)指控霍多尔科夫斯基曾在1998年策划谋杀西伯利亚某市的市长弗拉基米尔椠﹏霍夫(Vladimir Petukhov)并企图谋杀其他4人。
On Wednesday, Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the committee, said that in connection with the case an international arrest warrant had been issued for Mr Khodorkovsky, who has been living in Switzerland and London since his release from jail.
该委员会发言人弗拉基米尔氠尔金(Vladimir Markin)周三表示，由于与此案有关，已向霍多尔科夫斯基发出全球逮捕令，霍多尔科夫斯基自获释以来一直生活在瑞士和伦敦。
