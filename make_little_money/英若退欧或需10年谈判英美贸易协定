 The UK could have to wait up to a decade to negotiate new trade deals with the US if it leaves the EU, Barack Obama said as he stepped up his warnings against Brexit.
 巴拉克•奥巴马(Barack Obama)加强了他对英国退欧的反对，声称如果英国退出欧盟(EU)，可能要等上10年才能和美国谈判达成新的贸易协定。
 The US president has prompted the wrath of Eurosceptic campaigners by warning that Britain would lose influence if it left the bloc.
 美国总统警告称，英国如果离开欧盟将失去影响力，这一说法激怒了英国退欧阵营的积极分子。
 Last week, during a press conference at the Foreign Office, he warned that the UK would have to go to the “back of the queue” if it wanted to sign a new trade deal with his country.
 上周，在英国外交部(Foreign Office)的一场新闻发布会上，奥巴马警告称，如果英国想要和美国签署新的贸易协定，英国将不得不排到“队尾”。
 On Sunday, he spelt out what that meant, saying: “It could be five years from now, 10 years from now before we were able to actually get something done.”
 周日，他进一步亮明了这句话的含义，称：“从现在起可能要花上5年，10年，我们才能实际上办成一些事情。”
 Europe was the US’s largest trading partner, Mr Obama said, adding that the UK would have “less influence in Europe and, as a consequence, less influence globally” if it left the EU.
 奥巴马表示，欧洲是美国最大的贸易伙伴，他补充说，如果英国离开欧盟，英国“在欧洲的影响力会减弱，在全球的影响力也会随之减弱”。
 His warning over trade has angered UK campaigners for leaving the EU, including Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who dismissed Mr Obama’s comments as “utter tosh”.
 他在贸易方面的警告激怒了英国退欧阵营的积极分子，包括英国独立党(UKIP)领导人奈杰尔•法拉奇(Nigel Farage)，后者称奥巴马的评论是“一派胡言”。
 Mr Farage accused the president of “coming to London to threaten us” with empty claims. “Who cares what the US wants? It’s what we want that matters,” he said.
 法拉奇指责美国总统用空洞的主张“到伦敦来威胁我们”。“谁在乎美国想要什么？我们想要什么才重要，”他说。
