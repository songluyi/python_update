The renminbi fell to a five-year low against the U.S. dollar on Monday after statistics indicated weaker-than-expected Chinese economic growth momentum in December.
Paul Mackel, global head of emerging markets foreign exchange strategy at HSBC Holdings, predicted that the renminbi will fall further in 2016 to about 6.70 to the dollar by the end of the year.
