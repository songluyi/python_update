 Business sentiment in China held steady in March, but still remains downbeat on the whole.
 3月份中国企业信心指数保持平稳，不过总体上依然低迷。
 The MNI China business sentiment index has come in at 49.9, steady on February’s level and the second straight month it has been below the 50 mark that separates optimism from pessimism.
 3月份，MNI中国企业信心指数(MNI China Business Indicator)读数为49.9，稳定在2月份的水平。这也是该指数连续第二个月低于50。50是该指数区分乐观和悲观的荣枯线。
 An upshot, MNI said, is that “firms remained more upbeat about the coming three months” with the future expectations indicator rising further above the current measure.
 MNI表示，其中一个调查结果是，“企业对今后三个月依然持更加乐观的态度”，未来预期指数在目前读数的基础上进一步增加。
 MNI pointed out weakness in overall sentiment is masking improvements in other key parts of the survey, in particular production and new orders, which picked up this month after a retreat in February.
 MNI指出，企业总体信心的疲软掩盖了调查中其他重要子项目情况的改善，尤其是生产和新订单方面，它们在2月份的下跌后已在本月回升。
 The People’s Bank of China’s recent cut to commercial banks’ reserve requirement ratio took place during the March survey period, and MNI says this was partly reflected in the results, with the cost of credit measure edging lower from February.
 中国央行(PBoC)近期降低商业银行存款准备金率就发生在3月份的调查期间，MNI表示这在调查结果中也有部分体现，信贷成本指数略低于2月份。
 Although increased disinflationary pressures in the prices that companies charge were still evident in March, this was present alongside an unexpected rise in input prices, MNI said.
 MNI表示，尽管3月份企业报价中通缩压力增大的迹象仍然十分明显，与这种现象伴随的，却是投入价格出人意料的上升。
