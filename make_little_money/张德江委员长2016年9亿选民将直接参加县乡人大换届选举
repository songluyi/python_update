Over 900 million voters are expected to directly elect more than 2.5 million local legislators in grass-roots elections beginning 2016, said China's top legislator in an annual work report on last Wednesday.
In China, representatives to local people's congresses at the county and township levels are elected directly and constitute over 90 percent of legislators at all levels nationwide, while representatives to a people's congress above the county level will be elected from the people's congress at a lower level.
