China plans to restore the admission of pediatric undergraduates in universities to cater to the increasingly urgent demand for pediatricians after the country's only-child policy was loosened.
In 1998, the Ministry of Education closed all undergraduate pediatrics departments in the country's universities in order to adopt a more general medical education system. The decision greatly reduced the number of pediatric graduates.
