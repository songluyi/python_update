North Korea conducted a 'successful' hydrogen bomb test, Pyongyang has confirmed. The thermonuclear weapon triggered a massive 5.1 magnitude earthquake when it exploded at 10am local time on Wednesday.
The successful detonation marks a major step in North Korea's nuclear development and is bound to cause considerable anxiety to neighbouring countries.
