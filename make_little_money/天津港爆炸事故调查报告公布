A State Council investigatory team has identified 123 people responsible for the Tianjin warehouse explosions in August that killed at least 165 people and put direct economic losses at 6.87 billion yuan (about 1.1 billion dollars).
After five months of investigation, the team has concluded that the disaster, "an extraordinarily serious production safety accident," was caused by ignition of hazardous materials, improperly or illegally stored at the site.
