Fragile indirect negotiations to end Syria’s nearly five-year-old conflict went into a second day Tuesday in Geneva with both sides accusing each other of lacking good will.
旨在结束叙利亚近五年冲突的间接谈判步履艰难。日内瓦的谈判星期二进入第二天，双方相互指责缺少诚意。
U.N. Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, went into talks Tuesday with a delegation representing the government of President Bashar al-Assad, a meeting that he had postponed from Monday while he convinced the opposition to stay on.
联合国叙利亚问题特使德米斯图拉星期二与叙利亚总统阿萨德的代表团举行会谈。德米斯图拉为了说服反对派继续参加谈判把与叙利亚政府的会谈从星期一推迟到星期二。
De Mistura declared the talks officially under way late Monday, following a two-hour meeting with the opposition.
德米斯图拉同反对派举行两小时会晤后星期一傍晚宣布，谈判正式展开。
“As far as we are concerned, their arrival to the Palais des Nations and initiating the discussion with us is the official beginning of the Geneva talks,” the U.N. envoy said.
The formal start came exactly one week after they were originally scheduled to begin.
正式谈判的启动比原计划晚了一星期。
Talks were delayed by discussions of who should represent the opposition, then by an opposition boycott and the opposition’s demands for an end to air strikes and a lifting of blockades on rebel-held areas.
由于讨论反对派代表的人选问题，谈判开始的时间被推迟，之后又因反对派的抵制再次被推迟，反对派还提出，要以结束空袭和解除对反政府力量控制区的封锁为先决条件。
