Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney eviscerated current Republican frontrunner Donald Trump in a remarkable speech, casting him as unfit to be the president of the United States. Romney appealed to Republican voters to consider the consequences of a vote for Trump in caucuses and primaries across the country saying: “If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are diminished.”
美国前总统候选人罗姆尼在一次重要讲话中称目前共和党党内竞选的领跑者川普不适合成为美国总统。罗姆尼呼吁共和党选民要考虑在全国各地的党团选举和初选中投票给川普的后果。他说，“如果我们共和党人选择川普作为我们的候选人，将使我们未来的安全和繁荣前景暗淡。”
Romney made clear that he, himself, is not planning to run and called on voters to consider any of the four remaining Republican candidates, cautioning that: “A person so untrustworthy and dishonest as [Democratic candidate] Hillary Clinton must not become president.” But the former Massachusetts governor said Trump has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president.
罗姆尼明确表示他本人并不打算竞选，但呼吁选民们考虑其余四名共和党参选人中的任何一位。他提醒说：“不能让希拉里·克林顿这么不值得信任、不诚实的人成为总统。” 但是这位前马萨诸塞州州长也说，川普缺少当总统的气质和判断力。
Romney, who ran unsuccessfully against President Barack Obama four years ago, spoke in Salt Lake City, Utah, Thursday, at the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics Forum.
罗姆尼四年前作为共和党总统候选人与奥巴马竞选白宫后落败，他星期四在犹他州盐湖城的犹他大学欣克利学院政治论坛上发表了上述讲话。
Romney's attacks on Trump contrast markedly with the two men's relationship in 2012, when billionaire real-estate mogul Trump championed Romney, who in turn praised Trump's business expertise.
罗姆尼对川普的攻击与两人在2012年时的关系大相径庭。当时房地产亿万富翁川普拥护罗姆尼，而罗姆尼反过来称赞川普的经商才干。
