A six-month investigation into a cruise ship that capsized on the Yangtze River in June found that heavy storms and management errors were the main causes of the tragedy.
The Eastern Star, which was carrying 403 tourists, 46 crew members and five travel agency staff, was on an 11-day cruise along the Yangtze River when it capsized on the night of June 1, 2015. As many as 442 lives were lost, and only 12 people on board survived.
