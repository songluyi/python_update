British Prime Minister David Cameron says he's confident the European Union will agree to the reforms he is seeking next year, indicating he may call a referendum on Britain's membership well before his self-imposed end-of-2017 deadline.
Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said Cameron's benefits-limiting proposals "are not acceptable to Poland." "We are open to discussion and compromise," she said. "But today many well-educated Polish people live in the U.K. and work there and are building the GDP of Great Britain."
