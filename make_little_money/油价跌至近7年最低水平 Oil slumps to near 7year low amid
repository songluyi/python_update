Oil slumped to its lowest level since the financial crisis as traders reacted to a rancorous Opec meeting last week that exposed the organisation’s inability to tackle a global glut.
油价跌至金融危机爆发以来的最低水平。上周石油输出国组织（Opec，简称欧佩克）举行了一场气氛紧张的会议，暴露出该组织无力应对全球石油供应过剩的情况，石油交易商们对此作出了反应。
The seven-hour meeting ended in chaotic scenes on Friday evening and highlighted the growing discord between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of Opec’s most powerful members, as Tehran prepares its return to international markets next year when sanctions are lifted.
长达7个小时的会议上周五晚在一片混乱中结束，凸显出最具实力的两大欧佩克成员国——沙特阿拉伯与伊朗之间日益不和。德黑兰准备在明年制裁解除后重返国际市场。
As oil traders delivered their verdict yesterday, Brent, the global benchmark, dropped 5 per cent towards $40 a barrel, its lowest level in almost seven years. US marker West Texas Intermediate fell 5 per cent to $37.84.
在昨日石油交易商作出其“判决”之际，全球原油基准布伦特(Brent)下滑5.35%，至40.70美元/桶，这是近7年来的最低水平。美国原油基准西得克萨斯中质原油(West Texas Intermediate)下跌5.85%，至每桶37.63美元。
“The latest Opec meeting yielded no change and no words about how the cartel is going to deal with the additional supply from Iran next year,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank. “With no signs of non-Opec producers such as the US and Russia cutting back, at least not voluntarily, the near-term outlook for oil remains very challenging indeed.”
“最近一次欧佩克会议没有带来改变，没有关于该卡特尔将如何处理明年伊朗新增供应的片言只语，”盛宝银行(Saxo Bank)大宗商品策略主管奥勒汉森(Ole Hansen)称，“没有迹象表明美国和俄罗斯等非欧佩克石油生产国将要减产，至少不是自愿减产，近期油价前景的确仍然非常具有挑战性。”
Shares in the biggest oil groups tumbled as investors factored in the hit to revenues from what one analyst called “a lower for even longer” price slump.
有分析师称，油价甚至将“在更长时间内徘徊在更低水平”，投资者意识到这将打击生产商的收入，全球各大石油集团的股价下跌。
