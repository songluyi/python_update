Leading Chinese search engine Baidu could go out of business if it doesn't move quickly to regain users' trust after a scandal around health care advertising, CEO Li Yanhong told his staff in an email.
"With the recent resentment of our users, Baidu is facing a crisis that we have never experienced before," CEO Li Yanhong, known as Robin Li, wrote in an email to his staff. "Baidu could go out of business in just 30 days if we lose our users."
