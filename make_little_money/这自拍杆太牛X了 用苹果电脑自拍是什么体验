　　Prepare for a major eye-roll: Three imaginative young men in New York have dreamed up — and created — an industrial-strength selfie stick, big enough to support an entire laptop.
　　准备好翻白眼吧：三个想象力颇丰的年轻人在纽约异想天开，并且创制了一根强劲的自拍杆，杠子够长够大，足以支撑起一台苹果笔记本电脑。
　　The Macbook Selfie Stick functions just like a smartphone selfie stick — except that it can fit a full-size Macbook computer in its grips.
　　苹果笔记本电脑自拍杆和智能手机自拍杆功能一样，只不过其把手握柄可以完全撑起一台电脑。
　　Created by artists Moises or Art404, John Yuyi, and Tom Galle, the Macbook Selfie Stick is, at this stage, still just an art project.
　　这一由艺术家莫希斯(也称“艺术404”)、约翰·余艺还有汤姆·盖伊所创制的苹果笔记本自拍杆，现阶段还只是一个艺术项目。
　　But while the trio may be trying to make some sort of statement about society — that our culture is too selfie-obsessed, self-obsessed, or tech-obsessed — it's quite possible that their plan will backfire.
　　尽管或许三人正试图从某种层面彰显社会，我们的文化执迷于自拍、痴迷于自我、热衷于科技，但很有可能他们的计划会适得其反。
　　In a series of images posted online, the group and a few volunteers pose for pictures, their laptops held out on a pole several feet in front of them, in places like Times Square and Washington Square Park.
　　网上贴出的一系列图片里，这组人和其他志愿者在时代广场、华盛顿广场公园等地方摆好造型拍照，电脑装在杆子上，撑开几英尺远。
　　In several of the snaps, crowds of tourists can be seen nearby, and many seem unfazed by the spectacle. A few, though, look on with bemused expressions.
　　可以看见，不少照片上附近有成群的游客，但很多人似乎对这一景象无动于衷。还有些游人在旁看着，一脸茫然。
　　Most people are probably quick to write off such a ridiculous idea — after all, carrying around a laptop and hoisting it up for a picture is certainly cumbersome, with or without a selfie stick. However, not everyone is so put off.
　　多数人很快就打消了这么个荒谬的注意，毕竟，带着个手提电脑，高高举起拍照确实够笨重的。
