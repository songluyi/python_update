In China, it's common to see children attending extracurricular classes, playing instruments, or simply doing their homework with their parents by their side, looking over them.
Feng Yan is one of these parents. On Saturdays, she has to get up at 6:30 am to prepare breakfast for her son. Then she wakes him up, so he won't be late for his extracurricular classes at 8 am. Her son is a sophomore in high school and is facing the gaokao (college entrance exam) in a year.
