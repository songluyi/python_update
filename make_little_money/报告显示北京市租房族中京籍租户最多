Seven million people in Beijing - about a third of the population - rented their homes last year, a recent report said.
Last year, Liu Peng, who owns an apartment near the Fifth Ring Road, rented a two-bedroom apartment in Dongzhimen because his daughter started studying nearby at the prestigious Shijia Primary School. They live in the rented place on workdays, which costs them 7,500 yuan per month ($1,094), and spend the weekend in their own apartment.
