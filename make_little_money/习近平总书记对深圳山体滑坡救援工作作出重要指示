Three people were injured and 27 remain missing after a landslide buried 22 residential and industrial buildings in an industrial park in south China Sunday.
An employee with the Liuxu Technology Co. in the park said power supply in the company suddenly went down at around noon. "I saw red earth and mud running towards the company building," he said. "Fortunately, our building was not hit, and all people in our company were safely evacuated."
