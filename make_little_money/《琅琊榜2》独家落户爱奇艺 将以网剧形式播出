Chinese online streaming site iQiyi has struck a deal with the producers behind hit TV drama "Nirvana in Fire" to exclusively broadcast the show's second season.
It's not clear at the moment if the cast will return to reprise their roles in the first season. "Nirvana in Fire" gained huge fandom last year, with online comments crediting it as the best TV show in 2015.
