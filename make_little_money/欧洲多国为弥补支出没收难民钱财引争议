Germany has begun taking cash and sentimental jewellery from wealthier refugees in return for aid.
The move, which is strikingly similar to Germany in 1939 during World War II, has been backed by opposition Green Party MP, Volker Beck, who said: "Asylum seekers aren't in a better position than those on unemployment benefits. Asylum seekers must repay the costs of accommodation and care to the state."
