Chinese authorities have arrested nine people in a recent milk powder scandal, which involved the production and selling of fake baby formula under the brands of "Similac" and "Beingmate".
The fake products had been sold into four provinces, including Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Hubei, according to Yan Zuqiang, deputy director of the Shanghai food safety office.
