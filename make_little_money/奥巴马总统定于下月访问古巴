White House officials say President Barack Obama will visit Cuba next month, a major, symbolic step in the warming of ties between the two Cold War enemies.
白宫官员说，奥巴马总统定于下月访问古巴，这将是增进这两个冷战对手间关系的具有象征意义的重要步骤。
The Obama administration will formally announce the trip Thursday, according to a senior administration official, who said the visit will be a part of the president's travels to Latin America.
美国政府一名高层官员说，奥巴马政府将于星期四正式宣布这次访问。他表示，此行将是奥巴马总统出访拉丁美洲的组成部分。
CNN reported the visit is planned for March 21-22, before the president flies to Argentina.
美国有线电视新闻网说，奥巴马计划于3月21日至22日访问古巴，随后前往阿根廷访问。
The trip had long been expected as part of Obama's effort to make as much progress as possible in improving ties with Cuba before he leaves office in January, 2017.
奥巴马希望在2017年1月离任前最大限度地改善美古关系，出访古巴早在外界预料之中。
Late last year Obama said he would like to visit Cuba by the end of 2016, but only if the Communist-led country makes enough human rights reforms and he can meet with political dissidents.
奥巴马去年年底曾表示，他愿意在2016年年底前访问古巴，但前提条件是古巴在人权方面做出足够改革，以及他在访问期间可以会见持不同政见者。
Cuban officials have not commented on the reported Obama visit. After the president's comments in December, Havana said they welcome Obama, but warned him against meddling in the country's internal affairs.
古巴官员尚未对有关奥巴马访问的消息发表评论。针对奥巴马去年12月的表态，哈瓦那对奥巴马表示欢迎，但警告他不要干涉古巴内政。
