China will protect the interests of student interns from vocational schools by stipulating the minimum wage during their internships, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on last Wednesday.
Vocational schools and employers hiring interns are also forbidden from charging deposits of any kind, including salary commissions and management fees, the regulation said.
