China should stop subsidizing heavy-polluting activities and put a price on environmental damaged. Depleting environmental resources has anyway a very high opportunity cost as it jeopardizes the country's future. Imposing more order and regulations would promote cost reduction, and help the country's economy to focus on cleaner ways to grow.--John Louis from Germany
Maybe the Chinese government can do something to all the parents of "parachute children": if you send your child away, consider the child's interests! Parking your child in a boarding school is not ideal. But in China, parents believe boarding schools are better places than the home. Therein lays a cultural difference between the West and China. Chinese parents seem to shove their responsibility away from them in the hope that their child gets a public education from a boarding school. In reality, children in boarding schools suffer from home sickness.--Seneca from US
