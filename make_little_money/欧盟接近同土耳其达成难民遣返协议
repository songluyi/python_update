 The EU is close to a deal with Ankara that would see all non-Syrian migrants reaching Greek islands returned to Turkey, marking a crucial step in the bloc’s hardening stance against the flow of people pouring into its territories.
 欧盟接近与安卡拉方面达成协议，按照该协议，抵达希腊岛屿的来自叙利亚以外国家的所有难民将被送回土耳其，这标志着欧盟迈出关键的一步，对源源不断涌来的人潮立场转向强硬。
 After weeks of diplomatic pressure from Berlin and Brussels, Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish prime minister, privately signalled in negotiations yesterday that Ankara would accept the systematic return of non-Syrians and step up action against smugglers.
 在柏林和布鲁塞尔施加外交压力数周之后，土耳其总理阿赫迈特•达乌特奥卢(Ahmet Davutoglu)昨日在谈判期间私下发出信号暗示，安卡拉将接受系统化地遣返所有非叙利亚难民，并加大力度打击人口走私贩。
 Although the agreement is tentative, the terms could mark a long-sought turning point in Europe’s migration crisis, giving a harder edge to a strategy that has largely failed to dent flow of people across the Aegean Sea.
 虽然这份协议是试探性的，但其条款可能标志着欧洲的移民危机达到了一个各方努力已久的转折点，使迄今基本上未能阻止人潮渡过爱琴海的战略具备更加强硬的锋芒。
 The flood of migrants has triggered acute tensions within the EU as more than 1.2m people reached the 28-country bloc by sea last year. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has come under pressure at home and from other countries to stem the flow after she pledged to accept Syrian refugees last year and then sought an EU deal to share the burden with reluctant member states.
 难民洪流引发了欧盟内部的严重紧张。去年有120余万人从海路进入有28个成员国的欧盟。德国总理安格拉•默克尔(Angela Merkel)在国内外都受到要求阻止难民潮的压力，去年她曾承诺接受叙利亚难民，但随后寻求在欧盟内部就分摊难民安置负担达成协议，其中一些成员国对此很不情愿。
 Two diplomats familiar with the discussions yesterday said Turkey also agreed to accept all migrants rescued in international waters by a Nato mission — a sensitive issue that had held-up progress on the operation.
 熟悉相关商谈的两名外交官昨日表示，土耳其还同意接受北约在国际水域救助的所有难民。这是一个敏感问题，此前曾阻碍北约救助行动的进展。
