U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter isvisiting a U.S. warship in the South China Sea to emphasize the United States'commitment to security in that area, where territorial disputes have placeChina at odds with several of its neighbors.
美国国防部长卡特将视察部署在南中国海的航空母舰，强调美国致力于维护该地区的安全。南中国海领土争端导致中国与几个邻国关系紧张。
Carter announced the visit Friday in Manilaat the closing ceremonies of the U.S.-Philippines joint military exercises.
星期五在马尼拉举行的美国和菲律宾联合军事演习结束仪式上，卡特宣布了这一决定。
He said security in the region is likeoxygen -- if there is enough of it, it goes unnoticed. But, he added,"When you don't have enough, you can think of nothing else."
卡特说，南中国海地区的安全如同氧气，在氧气充足时，人们感觉不到它的存在，一旦氧气不足，人们就知道它的重要性无与伦比。
Carter said activities like the jointmilitary exercises the United States and Philippines just concluded areimportant to protecting security in the region. Carter said the first SouthChina Sea joint patrol was carried out in March. Defense officials say a secondjoint patrol was completed in early April.
卡特说，美菲联合军演这类活动对维护该地区的安全意义重大。卡特说，美国和菲律宾今年3月首次在南中国海进行了联合巡航。国防部官员说，第2次联合巡航4月初完成。
China protested Friday. Beijing said theUnited States is taking a "lopsided approach" favoring China's rivalsfor territory in the South China Sea. China claims almost the entire SouthChina Sea, and has aggressively carried out island-building and patrols inwaters that are claimed by other countries.
中国星期五提出抗议。北京表示，美国在南中国海争端问题上采取了偏向中国对手的立场。中国对南中国海几乎全部海域提出主权声索，并在其他国家声称主权的海域采取咄咄逼人的填海造岛及巡航行动。
