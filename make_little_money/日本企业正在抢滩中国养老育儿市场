Japanese companies are investing in China to prepare for demographic changes, seeking to capitalize on a rapidly aging population and a potential baby boom with the loosening of the one-child policy.
In China, housekeepers often offer nursing services as well. Nursing care provider Nichii Gakkan has acquired six housekeeping companies and is poised to buy 10 more. The Japanese company will provide specialized know-how to these businesses, helping them grow profits from nursing care. Nichii initially focused on Beijing and coastal areas and plans to expand inland, including into Chongqing.
