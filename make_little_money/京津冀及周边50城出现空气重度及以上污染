Due to high emissions of pollutants in winter and unfavorable weather conditions for the diffusion of pollutants, many parts of China are suffering from heavy air pollution, according to a statement on the website of the Ministry of Environmental Protection.
Among the 70 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and environs, 30 cities are affected by "severe" air pollution, and 20 others are "heavily" polluted, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said.
