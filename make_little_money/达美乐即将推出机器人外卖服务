Fast food giant Domino's has developed a self-driving robot that can deliver hot food and cold drinks.
The robot uses GPS for navigation and can sense and avoid obstacles as it travels. It is designed to travel on bike paths or footpaths and can reach speeds of 12 mph. The customer can get at the pizza by using a security code sent to the customer's phone.
