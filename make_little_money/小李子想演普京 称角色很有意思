After many stellar performances in his career, Leonardo DiCaprio has expressed his desire to play the role of Vladimir Putin.
出演过许多精彩角色的莱昂纳多·迪卡普里奥，这次想演普京。
In a recent interview with the German newspaper Welt, the 6-time-Oscar nominated actor revealed that he could imagine himself playing the role of the Russian President.
近日在接受德国报刊《Welt》采访时，这位六获奥斯卡提名的演员坦言考虑过扮演俄罗斯总统。
"Putin would be very, very, very interesting. I would like to play him," he said.
“演普京肯定会非常非常有意思，我挺想试一试。”他说。
The Golden Globe winner also shared his meeting with Putin in 2010 when he attended the International Forum on Tiger in St Petersburg.
这位金球奖得主还提到了自己2010年与普京见面时的情景。当时他正在圣彼得堡参加“保护老虎国际论坛”的活动。
"My fund has several projects aimed at financial support for protecting these wild cats [Siberia tigers]. Putin and I spoke only about these magnificent animals, not about politics," said Leo.
莱昂纳多称：“我名下的基金会有几个项目正在为保护这些野生虎类（西伯利亚虎）提供资金支持。当时普京只和我谈了关于老虎保护的事，并没有涉及政治。”
It seems that the Russian history surely fascinates The Revenant actor as he said, "I think there should be more films about Russian history because it has many stories worthy of Shakespeare. That is fascinating for an actor."
俄罗斯历史似乎也很吸引这位《荒野猎人》的主演，他说道：“俄罗斯历史上很多故事都不比莎士比亚笔下的作品逊色，我觉得非常值得拍成电影。这对演员来说太有吸引力了。”
But Leo hasn't restricted his choice to Russia's present leader only. He revealed that he wouldn't mind playing the role of leader of Vladimir Lenin, Russia's Communist revolution, or peasant-turned-emperor-shaman Grigori Rasputin.
然而莱昂纳多想演的可不止于俄罗斯现任领导人。他还表示不介意出演俄社会主义革命领导人列宁，以及格里高利·拉斯普京。后者是一位出身贫寒却最终成为沙皇御用巫师的传奇人物。
"Lenin also would be an interesting role. I would like also to star as Rasputin," said the Hollywood star.
“演列宁也会很有趣。我还想尝试一下拉斯普京，”这位好莱坞明星说道。
In another interesting revelation, Leo shared that he likes to refer himself as "half Russian" because his grandmother was from Russia.
他还透露了一个有趣的事实：他喜欢称自己为“半个俄罗斯人”，因为他的祖母来自俄罗斯。
