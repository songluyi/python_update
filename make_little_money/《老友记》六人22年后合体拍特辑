The cast of the hit sitcom Friends are to reunite for a two-hour special, according to US broadcaster NBC.
美国全国广播公司（NBC）发消息称，著名情景喜剧《老友记》的主演们将重新聚首，参与录制两小时的特别节目。
The actors behind Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross have all signed up for the special, a tribute to director James Burrows.
瑞秋、莫妮卡、菲比、乔伊、钱德勒和罗斯的扮演者们都已确定将出演这一致敬导演詹姆斯·伯罗斯的特辑。
Burrows helmed numerous episodes of the program and has just celebrated directing his 1,000th TV program.
伯罗斯执导过不少《老友记》剧集，而此次特别节目是为了庆祝伯罗斯执导第1000集美剧而筹划。
But NBC entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt suggested the six Friends may not appear together.
不过NBC娱乐部主席罗伯特·格林布拉特暗示，六位“老友”可能不会同时出现。
"I'm hoping all six will be in same room at the same time," he told reporters. But he added: "I'm not sure we logistically can pull it off."
Fans of the show have been hoping for more than a decade to see Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer back on screen together, but previous attempts have fallen short.
十多年了，老友粉们一直盼着珍妮佛·安妮斯顿、柯特妮·考克斯、丽莎·库卓、马特·勒布朗、马修·派瑞和大卫·修蒙能再次聚首荧屏，但以前的尝试都未成功。
The program ended in 2004, 10 series and a decade after it premiered on US screens. It made international stars of its little-known cast, winning a slew of awards and a huge audience in the process.
《老友记》2004年播完第十季后剧终，彼时距该剧初登美国荧屏已有10年。此前鲜有人知的剧中演员后来都成了国际巨星。在此过程中，该剧也收获了无数奖项，俘获了一众粉丝。
As well as Friends, Burrows was behind the camera for several of America's much-loved sitcoms, including Cheers, Frasier, and The Bob Newhart Show.
除了《老友记》，伯罗斯还拍过不少其它深受观众喜爱的美国情景剧，比如《欢乐酒店》、《欢乐一家亲》、《鲍勃纽哈特秀》等。
The special is scheduled to be broadcast on 21 February on NBC.
致敬特辑将于2月21日在NBC台播出。
