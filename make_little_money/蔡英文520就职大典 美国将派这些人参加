The American Institute in Taiwan on last Friday released the names of delegation members who are to represent the US at president-elect Tsai Ing-wen's inauguration in Taipei on May 20.
An official with one leading Taiwanese American group told the Taipei Times that members were "disappointed" with the delegation as announced by the AIT in Washington. The official said. "We certainly don't want to show disrespect to Ron Kirk, but we were hoping for someone with political clout."
