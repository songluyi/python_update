Mario Draghi said the European Central Bank was “ready to do its part” to make the eurozone more resilient, in the latest indication that it could unveil further stimulus measures next month.
欧洲央行(ECB)行长马里奥德拉吉(Mario Draghi)表示，欧洲央行“准备尽自己的力量”让欧元区变得更具韧性，这一最新迹象表明欧洲央行下月可能公布进一步刺激举措。
In his first public speech since European banks’ stocks were caught up in a brutal sell-off last week, the ECB president said the central bank would pay close attention to the impact of the recent falls in oil and commodities prices, as well as the ability of banks to pass on the ECB’s monetary policy.
在自欧洲银行类股上周遭遇惨烈抛售以来的首次公开发言中，德拉吉表示，欧洲央行将密切关注油价和大宗商品价格下跌的影响，以及银行传递欧洲央行货币政策的能力。
“If either of these two factors entail downward risks to price stability, we will not hesitate to act,” he said in a speech to the European Parliament. The euro fell 1.1 per cent to $1.1138 following Mr Draghi’s comments.
他在对欧洲议会(European Parliament)发表演讲时表示：“如果这两个因素之一给价格稳定带来下行风险，我们会毫不犹豫地采取行动。”在德拉吉发表此番言论后，欧元兑美元汇率下跌1.1%，至1欧元兑1.1138美元。
In December, the ECB cut a key interest rate to a historic low of minus 0.3 per cent and pledged to continue its 60bn-a-month bond buying programme until March 2017 in a bid to shore up the eurozone economy and push inflation closer to its target of just under 2 per cent.
去年12月，欧洲央行将关键利率下调至-0.3%的历史低点，并承诺在2017年3月之前继续其每月600亿欧元的债券购买计划，以提振欧元区经济，并将通胀推升至更接近其目标（略低于2%）的水平。
However, the moves failed to impress investors who had hoped for deeper rate cuts and additional bond purchases. Mr Draghi responded to these concerns in January, saying the ECB would “review and possibly reconsider” its policies, and he repeated this stance yesterday.
然而，这些举措未能打动投资者，他们原本期待更大幅度降息以及更多债券购买举措。今年1月，德拉吉曾对这些担忧做出回应，他表示欧洲央行将“评估并可能重新考虑”其政策，他昨日重申了这种态度。
