China's ICBC Standard Bank, the world's biggest bank by assets, has agreed to buy a massive vault in London. It will be the first Chinese lender to own a vault in London as it looks to grow its precious metals business.
China accounts for more than a quarter of global gold demand but trading of the yellow metal remains centred out of London and New York. Around $5tn (3.5tn pounds) in transactions were handled in London's bullion market last year.
