China on last Thursday confirmed it would send warships to join a major United States-hosted naval drill later this year, even as tension between the world's two largest economies mounts over the South China Sea.
"Joining these military exercises will be beneficial to improving the Chinese navy's ability to contend with non-traditional security threats. At the same time, it will also be beneficial to deepending China and professional exchanges and pragmatic cooperations with the relevant countries' navies." Wu Qian, a spokesman of China's Ministry of Defence, told a regular briefing.
