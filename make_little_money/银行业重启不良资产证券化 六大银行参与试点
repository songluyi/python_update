China has restarted nonperforming asset securitization after halting the business in 2009.
Bank of China is reportedly making the fastest progress among the six banks. It launched NPA securitization last year, submitted its plan on relevant products to the regulators, and is now adjusting its quota on the issuance of bad asset-backed securities according to the regulators' requirement.
