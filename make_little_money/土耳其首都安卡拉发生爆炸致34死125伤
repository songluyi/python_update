A car filled with explosives blew up in a public square in the heart of Ankara, the Turkish capital, on Sunday evening, killing at least 34 people and wounding 125 in the second such attack in the administrative heart of the city in under a month. Several vehicles at the scene were reduced to burnt-out wrecks, including at least one bus.
No group has yet claimed the attack. However, a security official told Reuters news agency that initial findings suggested it was the work of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) or an affiliated group.
