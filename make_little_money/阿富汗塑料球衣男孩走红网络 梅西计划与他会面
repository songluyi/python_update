Dressed in a tatty makeshift Lionel Messi soccer shirt styled from a plastic bag, a little Afghan fan dreams of becoming a soccer star one day like the Barcelona legend.
With his room adorned with posters of the star, the child known locally as Messi-e-Kochak (junior Messi) gained worldwide fame after photos of him dressed in the makeshift Messi shirt were posted on Facebook by his elder brother Hamayon.
