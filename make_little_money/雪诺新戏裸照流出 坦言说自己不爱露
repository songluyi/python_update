Actor Kit Harington might be dead on Game of Thrones, but in real life he's been plastered across the internet in the altogether.
男演员基特•哈灵顿也许在《权力的游戏》中已经挂了，但是在真实生活中他一丝不挂的照片却铺天盖地地出现在网络上。
The star - who plays Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy series - is currently appearing in Doctor Faustus at the Duke of York Theatre in London, in which he spends most of his time in his pants and eventually shows rather more.
这位在HBO奇幻电视剧中饰演雪诺的明星目前正在伦敦约克公爵剧院参演舞台剧《浮士德博士》，在这台剧中，哈灵顿大部分时间都只穿着内裤，到最后还会露得更多。
Harington's appearance in the updated Christopher Marlowe play has brought new audiences to London's West End, but some have taken to photographing the actor in the play, in the more intimate scenes.
哈灵顿在克里斯托弗•马洛戏剧改编作中的亮相把新观众吸引到了伦敦西区，但有些新观众却开始给这名演员在剧中的亲密场景拍照。
Pictures have appeared online showing Kit baring his behind, showering and in a sex scene where he wears something that wouldn't be out of place in 50 Shades of Grey.
传到网上的照片显示，哈灵顿光着屁股冲澡，还有在一个性爱场景中穿的那种东西，放在情色片《五十度灰》里面再合适不过。
The actor previously argued for the equality of nudity in Game of Thrones, after his character was seen diving into a pool naked, but because of an injury a body double was used.
这位演员早先在拍摄《权力的游戏》时曾主张裸戏平等化，此前他的角色赤身跳入池塘中，当时由于他本人受伤所以就用了替身。
"When it came down to it I had a broken ankle, so the only time you saw my ass, it wasn't my ass," he said.
He added of baring all on television: "It's only right, if you're going to make a show where nudity and sex is a large part of it, that you be a part of that."
谈到在电视屏幕上一丝不挂，他补充道：“只有在拍摄一部有大量裸体和性爱镜头的剧而你也要参与时，裸体才是可以接受的。”
"I wouldn't say I'd be happy about it," he said.
